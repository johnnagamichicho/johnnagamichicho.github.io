<center><h1>This is my Husband</h1></center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>On January 3,1999, only two months after he was told he had cancer, my 
husband passed away.  It happened so suddenly that I could not accept the 
reality of his death for a long time.  Then one day I entered his vacant 
study and saw a piece of paper pinned on the bookshelf.  On it was the 
title of the memoir that he had planned to write after his retirement: 
<I>This is my Master</I>.  The double meaning of the word 
&quot;master&quot; (<I>shujin</I> in Japanese means also 
&quot;husband&quot;) led me to think that perhaps he had left me an 
assignment, that I, who had accompanied him for over 50 years, should 
carry out what he could not, to write about how he was saved by 
Christ&#146;s love and how he had spent his life in grateful service. At 
first I hesitated because I am not a writer like my husband, and I was 
not at all sure that I would be able to express everything fully as he 
would have wished.  However, at the urging of my family who wanted to 
have a written record for the grandchildren, I decided to begin.  There 
may be inaccuracies in his life before we married, since these are 
second-hand memories.  I also want to include my parents in this story, 
because their influence, especially my father&#146;s, was crucial in 
shaping my own religious faith. Like my husband, my father dedicated his 
life to God.  For 50 years he served as head of the Kansai Theological 
Seminary.  My father always taught absolute obedience to God and parents, 
and my mother&#146;s steadfast loyalty to God and husband has been my 
role model through life.</P>

<h2>Chapter 1. My Family</h2>

<h3>I. My Father, Goro Sawamura</h3>

<P><B>The Early Years</B></P>

<P>My father was born on June 9, 1887, as the youngest of nine children 
of the head of the Higo (Kumamoto) clan on Kyushu, the southernmost of 
the four main islands of Japan.  His father was a solemn, traditional 
<I>bushi</I> (member of the noble warrior caste), who always kept his 
sword by his pillow.  As many <I>bushi</I> in those days did, he hated 
Christianity, and often quoted a line from the Old Testament, &quot;I am 
a jealous God,&quot; and concluded that the Christian god was quite 
dreadful.</P>

<P>When my father was four or five, during meals under the dim candle 
light his family would sometimes talk about relatives who had passed 
away.  This caused him to wonder what happened to those who died and 
asked, &quot;Why aren&#146;t they here any more?&quot;  His mother 
replied that they had all died.  He asked, &quot;You can&#146;t see them 
again?&quot; &quot;No you can never see them again,&quot; his mother 
answered. He then asked his mother, &quot;Are you going to die, 
too?&quot;  His mother said, &quot;Yes, I am the oldest here so I may die 
earlier than anybody else.&quot;  The thought that his mother might die, 
and that he would then never see her again suddenly made him sad and 
lonely.  Even after he had begun elementary school, he feared separation 
from his mother and she had to commute hand in hand with him every day.  
In those days he would pray to all the gods that he knew of before going 
to sleep.  He had no contact with Christianity.</P>

<P>During his earliest years his family lived in what was built as a 
second house for their clan chief, but with the beginning of the Meiji 
Restoration, the new government took away most of their property and, 
after various dealings, only a small parcel of land was left to their 
name.  But at that time his family still received crops from their 
tenants every year.</P>

<P>My father was not very healthy since birth.  He often had digestive 
problems, caught colds, and was absent from school.  Despite his weakly 
constitution, his heart was filled with both high hopes and grave doubts 
about life.  When he was in fourth grade the teacher asked him, &quot;What 
do you want to do when you grow up?&quot;  He answered, &quot;I want to 
develop my abilities and virtues, and raise the standard of 
society.&quot;  Then the teacher said, &quot;You can do that if you 
become like Buddha or Christ.&quot;  Afterwards the teacher complained to 
his colleagues that this student was too much of a dreamer.</P>

<P>He managed to continue with his studies and entered high school.  
However, when he was 18, what started out as a cold turned into high 
fever and the coughing up of blood.  The doctor concluded that there were 
two holes in his left lung and that he would probably never be able to 
lead a normal, vigorous life.  He recommended a quiet vocation as a 
country teacher to prepare for life-long rehabilitation.  My father 
despaired of ever realizing his dreams.</P>

<B><P>His First Church</P>
</B>
<P>After a while he recovered a little, but he still had a bad cough and 
stayed in bed most of the time.  His friends continued advancing in 
school, but he spent his days doing nothing, depressed and without hope.  
Meanwhile his family had run into financial difficulty and they were 
about to be forced into selling their land and house.</P>

<P>Then the oldest brother who had managed to support them became ill.  
Their mother, who was brought up in a wealthy home and had never 
experienced such hardship, tried to take care of her two sick sons.  It 
was heartbreaking for my father to see his mother in such a 
situation.</P>

<P>At that time a friend&#146;s aunt who lived nearby introduced him to a 
small Greek orthodox church in Kumamoto city.  She was a Christian who 
became concerned when she heard about his troubles.  When my father had 
recovered to the point where he could walk again, he went to visit the 
priest at the church.  He asked about the difference between gods in 
general and the Christian God.  The priest gave him an explanation, then 
started a lecture on Matthew Chapter 5.  My father did not understand it 
well, but he came to see this God as a loving father and creator of the 
universe.  That became his light and hope.  When he turned his eyes to 
heaven and called, &quot;Father,&quot; he felt tremendous hope and peace 
in his mind.  Meanwhile he regained his health day by day, so he decided 
to pursue this God throughout his life.  He felt that this was the only 
path for him to follow, and he subsequently lost all interest in other 
things.  He began to study the Bible and was baptized.  The priest 
recommended him to a theological seminary in Tokyo.</P>

<P>This was just after the Russo-Japanese War.  The head of the seminary 
was a missionary from Russia.  My father would be going to a foreign 
school, and it was run from headquarters in a recent enemy nation.  
People objected to his going, but his mother and brother understood and 
supported his decision.</P>

<P>My father studied with great passion.  It was not enough for him to 
attend regular classes--he read any book about religion and philosophy he 
could find in the library, and, whenever possible, attended meetings held 
at various churches to listen to well-known preachers.</P>

<B><P>Drafted</P>
</B>
<P>Since he became a Christian, my father remembered the sins he had 
committed in the past.  One of them he had committed in middle school.  
His brother was a teacher at that time. Just before graduation, his 
brother brought the grade book home, and he had a chance to see the book. 
He was at the top of the class!  He thought this impossible, because he 
knew there was another student who was doing better.  He recalculated 
their grades and, sure enough, he was right.  The other student should 
have been number one.  He knew he should tell his brother about the 
mistake, but he did not.  So he graduated as the valedictorian with all 
the honors accorded that position.  But that left a dark shadow in his 
heart.  Now God made him understand clearly that what he had done was a 
sin.  He brought a robe to a pawn shop and used the money to buy a book 
about Christianity, which he sent with a letter of apology to the student 
whom he had wronged, who was studying in Shanghai.  This was the first 
and last experience with a pawn shop in his life.  Eventually he received 
a letter from the other student, who also confessed to having committed 
various sins.</P>

<P>The time for the physical exam for the draft arrived.  Since he was 
not very fit he might have been released if he were examined in his home 
town, but since he was examined in Tokyo he passed.  After graduation he 
entered the Kumamoto troop.  The others treated him harshly because he 
was a graduate of a Russian missionary school.  But my father wanted to 
be faithful to God.  He crossed himself before every meal as he usually 
did, and soon everybody in the troop knew that he believed in a strange 
foreign religion.  One of the training officers took away his diary in 
which he wrote his honest criticism of the army based on his faith.</P>

<P>One day the training officer summoned him and asked if he had 
complaints about the army.  My father took this opportunity to talk about 
his God and faith passionately.  The argument grew heated and both of 
them raised their voices.  Everyone listening thought that they were 
quarreling and worried.  Later that night he was summoned again.  He 
wondered what was going to happen to him and went to the officers&#146; 
room praying to God.  But when he entered the room, the officers looked 
relaxed.  And he found his cousin sitting in the corner of the room.  The 
training officer asked, &quot;Do you know  Mr. Asada?&quot;  My father 
and his cousin saw each other and smiled.  His cousin was sent as an 
officer-in-training and had apparently put in a good word for my father.  
Furthermore, when the next training officer arrived he told my father, 
&quot;Your ancestors took good care of my ancestors.&quot; And he was 
very kind to my father.  God helped my father and protected him in such 
ways.</P>

<P>After that his troop was assigned to occupied Korea.  The main troop 
stayed in Seoul but my father&#146;s group of around 30 soldiers was sent 
to a small coastal village on the Sea of Japan.  There was no public 
transportation, but he savored his walks in the bucolic scenery that 
seemed to be frozen in a far away past.  In his spare time he went 
hunting for game with his army rifle, and, thus, supplemented his army 
ration.</P>

<P>In those days the Japanese army was stationed all over Korea.  For 
transporting materiel, it used a system called <I>muraokuri</I>.  Coolies 
from a village would be commandeered to carry loads to the next village, 
where the original men would be released and new ones forced to take up 
the task, then on to another village like a relay.  Since young and 
strong men were working during the day, old men, often bony and weak, 
were forced out of their homes at bayonet point to do the job.  My father 
could not bear to watch such indignities, so he begged a commander who 
had come on patrol to ease up on those people, but the answer was 
&quot;This is small compensation to us who are here to defend their 
land.&quot;  So my father sent an anonymous letter to headquarters, 
written as if by a businessman, saying if we continue inflicting such 
cruelty on the Korean people, they will hate the Japanese and rebel.  It 
may be just a coincidence, but within a month the order came from 
headquarters to cease the practice of <I>muraokuri</I>.</P>

<P>My father felt much pain and guilt about how his people were treating 
the Koreans.  He prayed, &quot;Dear God, I know that the Japanese will be 
punished if they continue in this way. Please forgive my country.  
Instead I will do anything for Korea.&quot;  Later he had a chance to 
fulfill his promise to God.</P>

<B><P>The Call</P>
</B>
<P>My father was discharged and went back to his home.  The first thing 
he had to do was to help his family financially.  His older sister who 
lived in Pyongyang (now the capital of North Korea) told him that jobs 
were plentiful there, so he went and found work at the post office.  
Perhaps it helped that the postmaster was a Christian, but my father did 
well there and was able to send home a good amount of money.</P>

<P>My father found a Methodist church to attend.  However, not long after 
this, the pastor left for the United States, and somehow my father and an 
elder became responsible for managing the church.  He worked very hard to 
spread the gospel.  Meanwhile, the church attendance kept gradually 
increasing, and many people were baptized.  He came to think of the post 
office work as meaningless.  The strong desire to wholly dedicate himself 
to God&#146;s work began to burn inside him.  Then Pastor Mimaki came to 
Pyongyang.  My father went to visit him and confessed what was in his 
heart.  The pastor told him to come to Arima and attend the annual 
meeting of Japanese evangelicals.  My father worried about the money for 
his family, but received permission from the postmaster to resign his job 
and left for Arima.</P>

<P>At the meeting he expressed his wish to devote his life to God.  
Pastor Mimaki told him, &quot;I wanted to devote my whole life as a 
batchelor, but I wasn&#146;t strong enough and married.  I hope you will 
succeed where I failed.&quot;  So my father thought he would remain a 
batchelor for life to serve God better.</P>

<P>However, after he was assigned to a church in Hakata, the senior 
pastors told him that he should get married if he was going to be a 
pastor of a church.  The conflicting advice was confusing, so he went 
into the mountains and prayed.  At first he was sure that God would want 
him to remain single, but through various indications from the Bible, 
such as how God gave Adam a wife, Eve, as his helper, he came to believe 
that God had an appropriate life partner for him.</P>

<P>Since my father had a tendency to be a hermit, I think he would have 
become a narrow-minded individual if he had stayed single.  After his 
marriage to my mother they hardly spent any time alone.  There were 
always relatives to take care of, and at times there were 14 or 15 people 
living under their roof.  I believe such a lifestyle helped to round out 
my father&#146;s personality.  He always told us he had no regrets nor 
complaints about his marriage because it was God&#146;s will.</P>

<h3>II. About My Mother, Momo&euml;</h3>

<P>My mother was born on Nov. 25, 1896 in the village of Aso, Kyushu, as 
the youngest of five children of a wealthy landlord.  Three of the five 
children died young so her parents were especially sweet to their 
youngest daughter and let her have her way all the time.</P>

<P>When my mother was 12 years old, she entered a private girls&#146; 
school in Kumamoto city.  She also became a Christian there after 
attending a Bible class led by a foreign missionary.  According to those 
who knew her, her behavior changed dramatically after she became a 
Christian--she became much more honest and forthright.  This led first 
her sister then her parents to become Christians also.</P>

<P>My mother graduated from high school when she was 17.  After that she 
obtained a certificate for elementary education and she became a teacher.  
Although she was baptized she still knew very little about her new 
religion.  When she was 21 she went to a spiritual retreat at Arima, and 
she was introduced to my father Goro as he was from the same home town 
and she could feel freer to ask him questions about the Bible.</P>

<P>My mother never dreamed of getting married to this man.  There was 
someone else arranged by her parents to marry.  But because this other 
man was not a Christian, her sister and friends from church were against 
the match and tried to persuade her to marry my father.  In any event, my 
father proposed and my mother&#146;s parents agreed since he was from a 
well-known family in their home town.  My mother was not happy about this 
marriage, because she regarded my father as a great spiritual leader and 
she thought of her own fledgling faith as a mismatch for him.</P>

<P>While they were engaged my mother received a few letters from my 
father.  When I once asked her what he wrote, she said she didn&#146;t 
remember precisely but that they were written very formally about serious 
matters such as, &quot;Dear maiden, as we are about to be betrothed, I 
need to ask you thus.  Firstly, are you prepared to sacrifice your life 
for the glory of God?&quot; and so on in rather severe terms.</P>

<P>My mother married when she was 22 and my father was 31.  After their 
wedding in Kobe they moved to Fukuoka and spent six years there until 
they moved to Mikage.</P>

<P>She expected that once she was married to him, she would be able to 
ask him a lot of questions about the Bible, but my father hardly spoke to 
her because he pitched all his energy and time into his job as a pastor.  
His schedule was very tight from early morning prayer meetings to 
late-night meetings.  Their household was very simple with a few items 
like a tea table and an orange crate used as a cupboard.  When my 
mother&#146;s father visited them, he was taken aback and said, &quot;You 
said you didn&#146;t need a dowry, but this is ridiculous.&quot;  So he 
had a chest made of paulownia, which was the best material available in 
Japan, and sent it to the newlyweds.  My mother cherished this chest all 
her life.  She always talked about their life in Fukuoka with a lot of 
affection.</P>

<P>Then my mother&#146;s father died, and her first son was born.  My 
father went to England to study.  After he returned to Japan he became 
the head of a theological seminary in Mikage.  It was founded in 
September 1924. There were only several students at first, but it 
quickly became bigger after it merged with the Kashiwabara seminary.  He 
also started a ministry for Koreans to keep the promise he had made to 
God.  He advertised their intention of this ministry in <I>Fukuin Shinbun 
</I>(an evangelical newspaper), which resulted in enough offerings every 
month to send several missionaries.  Also there were seminary applicants 
from Korea every year and they were preferentially accepted.</P>

<P>Then a problem occurred.  The city built a three-story elementary 
school building directly adjacent on the south side of the seminary 
dormitory, which blocked all sunlight so that even in the daytime the 
students needed to turn on their lights.  Many students got sick and 
finally two of them died.  My father prayed, &quot;I cannot educate these 
precious young men, who were called by you, in such an unhealthy  place.  
Oh God, please do not let them spend another winter in this dormitory.  
If they must live through another winter here I will resign.&quot;  He 
went to a board meeting of the Japanese Evangelical Society and presented 
his  need.  There was no budget for a new place, but God gave him some 
hilltop property above the small town of Shioya.  It was an isolated 
place surrounded by woods with a beautiful southern view of Awaji Island 
and the Inland Sea.  There could not have been a healthier location than 
this!  They were able to contract a first-rate architect from Kobe, and 
they planned the building with top priority on health.  The dorm rooms 
for 20 students were all placed on the south side.  And the required 
funds kept appearing as offering from various  people.</P>

<h3>III. About Myself, Shoko</h3>

<P>In 1930, when my father was 44 and my mother was 35, the seminary 
moved to Shioya.  I was four years old.  We were a large household, with 
my two older brothers, my deceased aunt&#146;s four children, 
grandmother, another aunt and her three children.  Then in the next few 
years my three younger siblings were born.</P>

<P>After my two older brothers went to school I was left alone, so I 
played in the natural environment of the woods and fields by myself.  
Nearby there was a village for foreigners, but I did not have any friends 
there.  I would pick wild flowers and float tiny boats made of leaves in 
the rivulets formed after a rain.  I grew more and more uncommunicative 
and antisocial, so my mother worried about me and asked the first grade 
teacher to allow me to sit in the classroom.  There was only one class 
per grade, and my teacher was very kind, so I came to like school very 
much.  One day I took a nap, which was unusual for me, and woke up 
thinking it was morning.  I shouldered my school bag and was about to 
leave, when my mother laughed and told me it was evening, but I thought 
she was joking and left the front door crying, &quot;I&#146;m late for 
school.&quot;  My mother let me go, but she followed me.  Eventually when 
it started to get darker and the moon came out, I realized I was wrong 
and I went home.  So I became a first grader a year early, but I enjoyed 
school so much that I did not mind the long commute at all.</P>

<P>Thinking back, I see my mother always wearing an apron and her hair 
tied back, working very hard cleaning house, doing laundry, and cooking 
meals for the huge family.  Clothes had to be washed by hand with a 
washing board and tub, and food had to be cooked over wood or charcoal 
fire.  She was in charge of the household and was almost entirely 
responsible for the children.  She prepared lunches and snacks for field 
trips, bought school supplies, paid attention to the children&#146;s 
grades, attended PTA meetings, and took care of anyone who got sick.  She 
reported every detail to my father, and they prayed together when there 
was a problem.  I often heard their prayer for each child from my 
father&#146;s study, and I felt very secure knowing that they always 
prayed for me.</P>

<P>At school all students were supposed to worship at the Shinto shrine 
once a month.  My father did not allow his children to bow in obeisance 
to the shrine, so my brothers and I  waited by ourselves at the bottom of 
the stairs of the shrine.  This caused some upperclassmen to harass us 
chanting, &quot;Amen, somen, hiyasomen&quot; (<I>somen</I> is a kind of 
Japanese noodle).</P>

<P>My mother transferred us to the elementary school in West Suma(?).  
When I was about to enter fourth grade, the principal told me I could not 
enter high school a year early (although boys were allowed to do this), 
so I was made to repeat third grade.  At first some boys teased me as a 
flunkee, but after I became class prefect nobody teased me anymore.  I 
liked this school, but soon there were too many students from outside 
districts, so they were asked to go back to their own school 
districts.</P>

<P>However, my mother transferred us to the elementary school in Tarumi, 
where, again, we had to commute by train.  My fourth grade teacher, Mr. 
Ogawa, was still in his 30s although I thought  he was about 50.  He once 
loved my drawing of him, so I presented it to him.  I also wrote an essay 
titled, &quot;My teacher, Mr. Ogawa&quot; and I concluded saying, &quot;I 
wish Mr. Ogawa would become a Christian some day.&quot;  I was really 
happy to hear that Mr. Ogawa started to attend church right after reading 
my essay.</P>

<P>One day a new student came to our class.  She was sitting in the last 
row looking lonely.  She was a Korean.  I asked the teacher to let me sit 
next to her, but for some reason he refused.  But the girl and I became 
good friends in no time, and I learned that her family was also 
Christian.  We became even closer then.</P>

<P>Fifth and sixth graders were very busy preparing for the the next 
level entrance exam.  When I was in fifth and sixth grade, I had to study 
after school until it got too dark to read what was written on the 
blackboard.  In winter it got dark earlier so I had to walk in total 
darkness up the quiet hillside road from the train station.  Past the 
pond where someone had been robbed and right by a vacant house where 
someone had been murdered.  The palms of my hands were wet with sweat as 
I prayed to God to protect me, and I did not let up until I could see the 
lights of my house in the distance.</P>

<P>I was not competitive, so I did not desire to be at the top of the 
class, but I hated getting bad marks, so I studied very hard.  The result 
was that I ended up at the most prestigious girls&#146; school in the 
prefecture.</P>

<P>After I entered high school I was freed from the extra studying, so I 
joined the track team.  It was great fun to practice after school every 
day.  Meets were always held on Sundays so I could not attend church.  I 
tried to go to the nearest church, but often I could not make it.  My 
father did not say anything about this, but I could see he was not happy.  
I started feeling guilty and could not enjoy the meets anymore.  Finally 
I quit the team.</P>

<P>During the first school year, I attended a New Year&#146;s evangelical 
service held at Minatogawa.  I knew a lot about the Bible because I had 
listened and learned since I was a young child.  But I had no 
consciousness that I was a sinner, so I could not feel an overwhelming 
sense of gratitude toward Christ who died for our sins.  When I saw 
people who were being converted crying with joy, I wished that I could 
also feel such great emotions.  So I often attended evangelical 
services.</P>

<P>The preacher of the day was Rev. Mimaki.  The scripture lesson was 
from Romans Chapter 8.  Verses 16-17 especially struck me: &quot;It is 
that very spirit bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of 
God, and if children then heirs, heirs of God and joint heirs with 
Christ--if, in fact, we suffer with him so that we may also be glorified 
with him.&quot;  I did not understand it completely, but I knew that I 
was a child of God so it seemed natural for me to suffer with Christ.  I 
didn&#146;t know why but I became very emotional and recalled the various 
wrongs I had committed in the past.  I apologized to God and asked  the 
pastor to pray for me.  For the first time I understood the meaning of 
Christ&#146;s crucifixion and tears flowed from my eyes.  That year I was 
baptized.  Though I decided I would always follow God&#146;s will, I did 
not know how God would make his will known to me.  Just then I found a 
book titled <I>Little Flower</I> on a bookshelf and I read it.  It was 
about St. Teresa who became a nun when she was just a girl and died while 
still young.  I wanted to be a nun and live like her, so I told my father 
about this.  He said, &quot;That is a very selfish idea.  We must live in 
this sinful world yet live a pure life to spread the Gospel.  I named you 
Shoko from Revelation 22:1, which says, &#145;Then the angel showed me 
the river of the water of life bright as crystal, flowing from the throne 
of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the 
city.&#146;  I wished you to become a water of life that is bright as 
crystal.&quot;  (<I>Sho</I> means &quot;crystal.&quot;)  I gave up being 
a nun then.</P>

<P>Second year in high school was the happiest time of my life.  My best 
friends and I formed a foursome and called ourselves The Four-Leaf 
Clover.  Ogawa-san was Love, Ohara-san was Happiness, Sakamoto-san was 
Hope, and I was Faith, because everyone knew I was a Christian.</P>

<P>Japan entered World War II during my second year in high school.  
English, as an enemy language, was removed from the required curriculum, 
but it could still be taken as an elective.  I regret now that I did not 
choose to take English!  The principal was replaced by  a right-wing 
nationalist, field trips were limited to visiting Shinto shrines, gym 
class became military training, air raid practices and bucket relays were 
held between class periods, and we were made to cultivate an overgrown 
field to produce extra food for the war effort.  Sometimes we had to walk 
home instead of taking the train to prepare in case public transportation 
was knocked out by an enemy attack.  During home economics class we sewed 
<I>monpe</I> (very plain clothes prescribed for women and girls during 
the war) and made<I> senninbari</I> (literally &quot;thousand-people 
needle&quot;), which was a white cloth with stitching by one thousand 
people, each stitch representing a prayer for victory; these cloths would 
then be sent to soldiers in combat.  Students in my class were born in 
the Year of the Tiger, and we were supposed to be stronger, so these 
<I>senninbari</I> came our way every day for rapid processing.  Male 
teachers were sent off to war, and those left were mostly old or sickly.  
Towards the end of the war, there were both teachers and students that 
died from malnutrition or from bombs.</P>

<P>On the first day of every month we were taken to the Ikuta Shinto 
shrine.  I had no courage to refuse, so I bowed in front of the shrine 
like the others.  I prayed, &quot;Please forgive me God.  Even though I 
am bowing, I am not worshiping this shrine.  I am very sorry but I 
don&#146;t have courage to say no.&quot;  I felt ashamed of my cowardly 
behavior.</P>

<h2>CHAPTER 2: My Husband, Kisun Cho</h2>

<P>My husband was born in a village northwest of Sunchon city, which is 
located on the southwestern end of the Korean peninsula.  Almost the 
entire village had the surname Cho.  Their ancestor was a decorated 
general.</P>

<P>He was born on January 15, 1920 (although this was according to a 
different calendar; his actual date of birth was probably sometime in 
February 1919) as the youngest son of six children, five boys and one 
girl.  His mother was 40 years old when he was born, and the second 
youngest was seven years older, so everybody loved him as the baby of the 
family, especially his mother.  They say that his mother loved him so 
much that she could not help smiling just seeing his just-worn clothes 
lying about on the floor.  When he was six years old he entered 
elementary school.  He told me himself, laughing, that every day, before 
and after school, he would still suckle at his mother&#146;s breast.  
There were students of varying age in his class--one even had a 
child--but there was only one girl in the class, because they thought 
girls did not need education in those days.  His mother dressed him in a 
pink <I>chogori</I> (Korean girl&#146;s dress) and braided his long hair.  
But his teacher cut his hair so he went home crying.  He was a 
mischievous child and he remained so until his last days.</P>

<P>His father was a gentle scholar of Chinese literature.  His mother was 
not educated, but she was a compassionate woman full of pathos, who 
managed the entire household.  I think Kisun inherited her 
character.  In villages there was a custom of poor people calling on 
wealthier households during meal time.  Whenever such poor people came to 
their house, Kisun&#146;s sisters-in-law did not welcome them.  But 
his mother always fed them willingly.  Thus, when she died later, all the 
poor people of the village came and wailed loudly for her.</P>

<P>Kisun had a scar on his forehead.  He got it as a baby when his 
sister fell backwards while she was carrying him on her back.  But the 
adults teased him saying, &quot;You were an abandoned baby that we found 
under a bridge, crying because crows were pecking on your forehead.  We 
felt sorry for you, so we brought you back home.&quot;  Sometimes when he 
was reprimanded for playing tricks, he would take the story seriously and 
complain, &quot;I really am a foundling, aren&#146;t I?  That&#146;s why 
I&#146;m so much younger than my brothers, and I get scolded 
more.&quot;</P>

<P>The house had a parlor for guests.  While visitors were inside
Kisun would tie their sandals together.  As the guests were leaving
they would stumble in their tied sandals, and he would giggle from his
hiding place.  If they came after him in bare feet, he would have them
chase him around outside and have a bigger laugh at their expense.
Also, in the summer he would walk by the neighbors&#146; houses and
stick a small twig into the swollen part under the flowers of the
pumpkin plants that everyone liked to grow.  The next morning the
small yellow blossoms would be dead.  He thought this was great fun,
but never did it to his own family&#146;s pumpkins.  Later when he
became a Christian he felt very sorry about this.</P>

<P>One day when Kisun overheard his mother and neighbors talking 
about somebody whose face they said looked like <I>yomogimochi</I> (a 
kind of rice cake), he suddenly got a craving for <I>yomogimochi</I> and 
started crying for it.  His sisters-in-law, disgusted with his selfish 
behavior said, &quot;We sure feel sorry for his future bride.&quot;  But 
when he would not stop crying, his mother, as usual, relented and told 
them to go pick <I>yomogi</I> grass and make the rice cake for him.  His 
sisters-in-law reluctantly went out in the rain to pick the 
<I>yomogi</I>.</P>

<P>His two older brothers went to the city to work, and they got 
tuberculosis.  His family sold part of their farm to pay their medical 
fee, so their budget became very tight.  He wore mended old socks that 
were hand-me-downs from his brothers.  Only on New Year&#146;s would he 
get new ones.  His desk was an apple crate, his notebook was papers cut 
and bound by hand, and he would practice his calligraphy on old 
newspaper.  He did not have crayons, so he had to borrow from his 
friends, but they did not have many colors, so his drawings were rather 
restricted.  He might have become more artistic if he had grown up in 
better conditions, for he always loved to look at paintings.</P>

<P>His village was not close to the ocean so they rarely ate fish.  Once 
in a while, when his brother would carry a load into town using their 
horse-drawn carriage, he would bring back fresh fish.  On such a days he 
could not wait for dinner.  The fish would be cooked with daikon radish 
from the garden, garlic, hot peppers, and soy sauce.  Each member of the 
family would encourage the others to eat more, parents putting food on 
the children&#146;s plates, the children saying, &quot;For you, 
mom,&quot; &quot;For you, dad,&quot; as if they were competing to see who 
could be most sharing.  They were a loving family.  Since they did not 
have much cash income, their meals were usually quite simple.  To make 
the rice go further, they would mix it with chopped up daikon, eat only 
&quot;junk&quot; grains and kimchi, or wrap steamed pumpkin leaves around 
rice and miso.  If dried anchovies were cooked with the ubiquitous 
daikon, it was considered a feast, and precious seaweed was reserved for 
when someone got sick.  New Year&#146;s was an exception.  They would 
splurge on tofu and soy bean sprouts, and butcher a pig that they shared 
with other villagers.  After boiling, the pork would be hung from the 
rafters, and slices from it would be offered to holiday visitors along 
with a cup of moonshine.  Two kinds of rice cake were made: one, which 
was formed into a hard cylinder and sliced obliquely to be put into 
soups; the other was a softer kind that would be roasted over a tin-can 
charcoal brazier then dipped in honey.  The latter was my husband&#146;s 
favorite and he would often reminisce nostalgically about its delicious 
taste.</P>

<P>After he graduated from elementary school he went to town to work.  He 
was hired by a Japanese shopkeeper as a live-in worker. He was worked 
from early in the morning until late at night.  And he was not allowed to 
eat his meals until all the family members had finished.  It was a harsh 
experience for a young boy.</P>

<P>He entered engineering school in 1932.  At that time his second oldest 
brother was working at an electric company in Kwangju after graduating 
from the Tokyo Electrical School.  So he lived with this brother and 
commuted.  His brother was a Christian who hosted worship services in his 
own house.  Every Sunday he would sit in the front row and turn back to 
see if his little brother was there, but once he confirmed this he never 
turned back again, so sometimes Kisun would sneak out to play.  He 
attended the services only because he would not get his allowance 
otherwise.  But it was his first contact with Christianity, and I believe 
that his brother&#146;s earnest prayers eventually helped lead him to 
become a Christian and devote his life to God.  At that time he dreamed 
of studying architecture and introducing ancient Korean architecture to 
the world.  At school he usually competed for the top spot with his best 
friend, who later became a university professor.</P>

<B><P>Manchuria</P></B>

<P>In 1937 Kisun graduated from engineering school and went to 
Manchuria (in occupied China) with his best friend to get a job.  At that 
time, highway robbers were still known to assault travelers in that 
region.  His mother cried when he left.  When he arrived he opened his 
luggage to find that the powdered hot pepper that his mother had wrapped 
in newspaper had burst and had dyed his clothes all red.  His eyes 
watered from the stinging peppers, but he was also crying thinking about 
his mother&#146;s feelings.</P>

<P>He worked at a Japanese police building construction site.  He came to 
hate the rude and arrogant behavior of the Japanese.  He sometimes 
attended a church,but nobody told him about salvation or baptism.  One 
winter night he went out to a vacant lot alone and knelt down to try 
praying for the first time.  He did not know how to pray, so he just 
asked, &quot;Please God, give me baptism.&quot;  Winter in Manchuria is 
severely cold.  So cold that when a man urinated, he had to keep a stick 
so that when the urine began to freeze from the bottom up like a reverse 
icicle, he could beat it down.  Or at least that is what he said.  And 
although he prayed in such conditions he did not get any answer.</P>

<B><P>Tokyo</P></B>

<P>One year later he and his best friend left for Tokyo for further 
studies.  Fortunately he was able to pass the entrance exam and entered 
the architecture department of the University of Japan.  The money sent 
from home was not enough, so he took many side jobs.  Once he followed a 
scrap collector to see how he made money.  The man walked around town 
yelling in a squeaky low voice, &quot;Scraaap, scraaap.&quot;  The man 
told him to try that but he could not find his voice.  At times someone 
stopped and handed them some iron scrap or old newspapers.  The man 
weighed the scrap and paid the customer some money.  Then he went to a 
dealer to sell everything he collected.  Kisun was not comfortable 
with this job, so he quit after one go-around.  Then he found a job 
drawing up blueprints.</P>

<P>Occasionally he attended a church in Kawasaki.  A young, recent 
seminary graduate named Yoshio Kuramochi was the pastor.  One Sunday he 
was called by the pastor after the service.  He sat in front of the 
pastor wondering what was the matter, then Kuramochi opened his Bible and 
began, &quot;These are the words of God.&quot;  He was offended and 
answered, &quot;Why do you say these are words of God?  Weren&#146;t they 
written by people?  Please don&#146;t insult my intelligence.&quot;  Then 
he kicked his chair and left.</P>

<P>He rented a small room and his next door neighbor was a worker from 
the Kawasaki Ship Building Company.  One Saturday night the neighbor had 
a party at his room with his buddies, drinking, singing, and laughing 
loudly.  The divider between the rooms was a flimsy sliding partition.  
Because Kisun had an exam on Monday he slid open the divider and 
asked them politely to be a little more quiet since he had to study.  But 
not only did it not get quieter, but they now had female company and 
things were getting wilder.  It became impossible to continue studying.  
He became extremely irritated and thought he could not take it anymore.  
He was trained in judo, so he stood up to give them a sound beating, but 
when he was about to open the partition he heard a voice saying, 
&quot;Who do you think you are?  Can you judge other people?  You would 
do the same things or worse if you had the time and money.&quot;  He was 
paralyzed as if he had been electrocuted, and then he sank back down 
weakly to his desk.  He could not study any more.  When he looked into 
his own mind, he recalled many bad deeds and thoughts one by one.  He 
started to write down everything he could remember in his notebook.  But 
soon he threw down his pen, sprawled on the floor, stared at the ceiling, 
and sighed deeply.  Am I such a bad person?  He did not sleep a wink that 
night.  Next morning he tore up the pages he had written and went to 
church.  The words of the sermon went in one ear and out the other.  He 
felt very badly about himself.  As soon as the worship was over, he told 
the pastor about the previous night&#146;s incident and asked if it was 
possible for even someone like him to be saved.  The pastor opened the 
Bible and read Isaiah 1:18: &quot;Come now, let us argue it out, says the 
Lord; though your sins are like scarlet, they shall become like 
wool.&quot;  Then he said that Christ died for you and paid off your 
sins.  The only thing you have to do is to believe this from the bottom 
of your heart and accept Jesus as your savior.  Then all your sins will 
be forgiven and you will become God&#146;s child.  Then the pastor prayed 
for him.  He was so happy to think about all his sins being forgiven that 
on the way home he felt like he was walking on air, and the scenery 
around him looked fresh and new.</P>

<B><P>The Failure of his First Evangelical Mission</P></B>

<P>He wanted to share this joy with his mother whom he loved most, so he 
went home as soon as summer vacation started.  He could not wait to 
finish his dinner and started to talk about what he had heard and learned 
from the pastor.  He himself knew little about the Bible, but he tried 
his best.  He began, &quot;Mother, everyone is sinner, and you are a 
sinner, too.  Please repent in front of God, who loved us so much that he 
sent his own son to be crucified to redeem us from our sins.  If you 
believe and accept Jesus Christ as your savior you will be saved.&quot;  His 
mother, who had been listening with a smile, now became angry and said, 
&quot;You call me a sinner!  What have I done?  I never stole nor killed 
anybody!  I sent you to a Japanese university in spite of our poverty, 
and this is what you&#146;ve learned?  To call your own mother a 
sinner?&quot;  Then she went straight to bed and did not take any food 
for days.  Though he begged her pardon on his knees, she was not soothed 
easily.  His first mission failed completely.  Because of this it took 
some time for his mother to become a Christian.  But several years later 
she became a convert.  She was baptized by her own son, called him 
&quot;Pastor,&quot; and treated him with respect as God&#146;s 
servant.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>

<P>At the time Kisun would tell his friends that one thing he did
not want to do was to become a pastor.  In those days pastors were
generally quite poor, and he viewed them with some contempt.  But
inside him the call to become a pastor sounded louder and louder.  He
tried desperately to escape this voice.  He still had conventional
aspirations to succeed in society.</P>

<P>One day he attended the farewell party for a pastor who was going
to China as a missionary.  The pastor told a story about how, as he
was struggling with his decision to go to China, he saw a piece of
white tissue paper, probably discarded by someone who had wiped his
nose with it, blown around by the wind while walking along a road.  As
he watched, he began to think of himself as being insignificant as
that piece of discarded waste, and yet God had cared about him.  Then
he decided he would go willingly wherever God wanted him to go.  As
Kisun listened to this story, he realized his own selfishness.  On the
way back he went into a cemetery to pray.  Then and there he repented
and made the decision to devote his life to God.</P>

<B><P>In Jail</P></B>

<P>Digressing a little, the night after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor,
Kisun was woken up by a loud banging on his door.  When he opened the
door, there were three policemen standing there.  Without saying a
word, they came into the room and threw all his books from the shelves
into a bag.  Then they told him to put on his clothes and come with
them to the police station for questioning.  He had no choice but to
do as he was told, so he got up and dressed to go.  Then they suddenly
handcuffed him.  It was a cold night.  He shivered both from the cold
and the fear.  He could not stop his teeth from chattering.  He prayed
desperately to God to help him.  Then he heard a voice telling him,
&quot;Do not fear, I am your Lord.&quot; Then he stopped shaking and
became calm.</P>

<P>When they arrived at the Kawasaki police station one of the
detectives told him to stay overnight since it was very late.  He
thought he was being taken to a room, but they took him to a jail cell
and pushed him inside.  There were already several people sleeping
there.  Gingerly he tried to move toward the back of the cell without
stepping on anyone.  Suddenly he heard someone saying in a low voice,
&quot;Hey!  Don&#146;t you say greetings when entering someone&#146;s
house?&quot; He turned toward the voice and saw a grim-faced man.  Who
knows what kind of terrifying crime he had committed?  The man pointed
toward the toilet seat and said, &quot;Newcomers go there.&quot; He
sat there obediently, bowed, and gave the proper greeting.  The cell
boss then asked him why he was here.  He answered that he was just a
student.  &quot;Hmm.  So you must be a Red.&quot;</P>

<P>Many college students at the time read books on Marxism.  Kisun, 
too, had borrowed one from his friend and read it.  Korean students were 
especially keen on Marxism.  With the country joining the war, the 
Japanese Special Police were especially vigilant about such potential 
subversives.  Kisun had unfortunately written down his criticisms 
and hatred of the Japanese in his diary.  The police had apparently 
become suspicious of him since he had dropped out of college just before 
graduation and had observed him preaching in the streets.</P>

<P>The interrogation was rough.  They asked him, &quot;Were you involved 
in any activities?&quot;  When he answered naively, &quot;Yes.  Judo, 
tennis, and, let&#146;s see...boating.&quot;  He was immediately hit by a 
bamboo stick.  &quot;Are you making fun of the police!?&quot; they yelled 
at him.  He was struck until the bamboo stick splintered into many 
pieces.  He finally realized why he was brought in when they told him to 
confess honestly that he had been involved in a Korean independence 
movement.</P>

<P>The meals in the jail were very poor--only a small amount of 
&quot;junk&quot; grains and pickled daikon.  It seemed that he grew 
hungrier after eating such small amounts.  He constantly thought about 
food.  The cells were set up to surround a jail guard, so he could see 
the people in the cell opposite from his own.  There was a Korean student 
on the other side, and they communicated to each other by tracing out 
words using their fingers on the opposing walls.  They comforted each 
other by writing about foods that they craved: chicken-and-egg rice bowl, 
sweet-bean-filled pastries, sukiyaki...</P>

<P>The investigation continued for many days, and although he was
weakened by hunger, his mind was at peace knowing that God was with
him.  While praying, God instructed him to fast, so he stopped eating
his meals and gave them to others in his cell.  Someone then told the
guard that Mr.  Kawamoto (his Japanese name; Koreans were required at
that time to take a Japanese surname) had not eaten his meals at all.
He must be sick.</P>

<P>That night a detective came to his cell and told him to come out.  He 
was then told to go home.  He could not believe it right away, so he just 
stood there.  Then the detective yelled, &quot;What are you doing?  I 
thought I told you to go home.  Just go!&quot;  He finally realized he 
was free, so he bowed and left in a hurry.  The fresh air smelled so 
good.  He went to the church straight away.  In the church, members had 
gathered to pray for him.  Everyone was excited and filled with joy to 
see him and thanked God for his release. </P>

<P>The next day the pastor went to the police to ask why Kisun had
been released, and he learned that since an inspector was coming to
check the condition of jails they were afraid to be reprimanded for
negligence if there were any sick prisoners, so they had released
anyone who appeared to be sick.  The church members realized then that
because Kisun had fasted he had been released, and they praised God.
He was baptized on Christmas day and received his Christian name,
Yosefu (Joseph).  Since then he was called Kawamoto Yosefu.</P>

<P>He now began serious preparations to go to a theological seminary.
Rev. O&euml; recommended him to go to the seminary in Tokyo.  But he
wanted to study under Rev. Goro Sawamura whose sermon had deeply
inspired him spiritually.  Pastor Kuramochi was a graduate from
Rev. Sawamura&#146;s seminary, so he encouraged him to go there.</P>

<B><P>About Japan&#146;s Colonization of Korea</P>
</B>

<P>I want to add a brief note here about the historical relationship 
between Japan and Korea.</P>

<P>Since the beginning of the the Meiji period in 1868, Japan&#146;s
continental strategy was to first conquer the Korean peninsula, and
this became more obvious after the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).
Winning the war brought international recognition for Japan as a
colonial player.  Korea was forced to sign a security treaty with
Japan, and, one by one, the Japanese took away the controls of
government.  In 1910, an annexation treaty was formally signed.  Not
only did Japan gain political and military annexation over the
peninsula, it also confiscated land from Korean landowners, and this
created a massive flow of displaced people.  Starting with members of
the disbanded Korean army, there was stubborn resistance against
Japanese occupation, but this was brutally suppressed.  It was not
until Japan surrendered to end World War II (1945) that Korea once
again became an independent nation.</P>

<B><P>Kansai Bible Seminary</P>
</B>

<P>Here I want to note some incidents that occurred in 1938.  In April
the Special Police sent by registered mail a questionnaire to churches
and seminaries consisting of 13 points concerning the relationship
between Japanese nationhood and Christianity.  One could read between
the lines and see their wish to purge the country of Christianity as a
foreign religion that could subvert Japanese nationalism.  My father
read this and thought that he must not be entrapped by them, but he
could not lie, either.  Cleverly he decided to use ideas and words
that were common to both Christianity and the traditional warrior
ethics of Japan, such as absolute obedience to the deity, and opined
that Christianity could complement the existing ethics of Japan.  He
also published these answers in the <I>Fukuin Shinbun</I>.  He was
sure that his response would not become fodder for religious
persecution.</P>

<P>But another letter came.  It said they understood that Christianity
can, indeed, be complementary.  So why not incorporate a Shinto altar
into the church and begin each service by worshiping it?  But this was
idolatry!  My father wrote a letter adamantly refusing such a
compromise.  At that time Rev. O&euml; was staying at the seminary, so
my father showed this letter to him.  He said, &quot;This is too harsh
and straightforward.  Why don&#146;t you wait a few more days and
see?&quot; So my father prayed for a couple of days, but he could not
think of a better answer.  However, when another pastor arrived from
Tokyo, he reported that the commander who had ordered the
questionnaires had suddenly been killed by a stroke, so they began to
think it was dangerous to get involved in religious affairs and
stopped whatever they were trying to do.  In this way God saved my
father and his seminary from the crisis.</P>

<P>By this time Japan&#146;s war in China was getting worse, and the 
Japanese government declared a national emergency.  Most of the 
missionaries sent to the continent were recalled.  Although there were 
many seminary graduates who had gone to China as missionaries, as the war 
progressed, many of them ended up being drafted to fight the people they 
wanted to save.  Some died in action.  The number of students dwindled at 
my father&#146;s seminary as more and more young men were drafted.  At 
one point there were only Korean students left.  The Special Police often 
came to check on school meetings and to investigate Korean students.  But 
when my father traveled around Korea during school vacations to 
evangelize, from Pusan to Masan, then Kyongju, Taegu, Kwangju, Seoul, and 
Pyongyang, he was welcomed and helped by his seminary graduates in each 
place.</P>

<P>I remember once going to meet my father at the train station as he was 
returning from one of these trips to Korea.  My younger brother and I 
helped him carry his bags up the steep road to our house.  Inside a woven 
basket there were many exotic foods from Korea--steamed rice cake stuffed 
with dried fruits, chestnuts, and pine nuts flavored with sesame oil and 
honey, assorted other rice cakes, rice candy, fish fillet fried in egg 
batter, etc.  They were delicious and we were all very happy.</P>

<P>Kisun entered the seminary in those days.  Because there were few 
students, there was close contact between the teachers and the pupils.  
He was able to ask my father direct questions about the plight of his 
country.  Why is Korea colonized and despised by the Japanese, why 
doesn&#146;t God bless Korea?  My father opened the Old Testament and 
told him that the hand of God always worked behind the history of each 
country, and that He would restore Korea some day.  And he prayed with 
Kisun for Korea and told him to keep praying with patience.</P>

<B><P>Please Give me Five Yen</P>
</B>

<P>One day Kisun went to a book store with his upperclassmen.  Because of 
the general paper shortage, new books were rarely available, so they 
looked through the used books.  Among them he found a book he had been 
wanting for a long time.  It cost five yen.  He had just five yen in his 
wallet, but it was for his food.  He could not spend the money but he 
wanted the book.  There was only one book so he was afraid it would be 
gone if he came back later.  He bought the book.</P>

<P>On the way back he prayed to God, &quot;Please give me five yen.  I 
decided to buy the book because I really need it, but now I have no money 
for food.&quot;  When he was back in his dorm, he found a piece of 
registered mail waiting for him.  It was from a friend in Gifu who was a 
Christian and was always praying for him.  He hurried to open it and 
found a money order for five yen inside.  He shouted hurray, then knelt 
down to give thanks to God.  Some might say it was just a coincidence, but 
he believed that God had met his needs through his friend.  This gave him 
confidence and peace of mind in future years that God would always take 
care of one who had dedicated his life to God.</P>

<B><P>A Cross Drawn in Blood</P>
</B>

<P>One of the departing graduates asked Kisun to succeed him at a church 
in Mita.  This was his first pastoral experience.  There were several 
Korean families there who gathered to worship at the Parks&#146; home.  
He enjoyed going there because they served Korean food.  The Park couple 
were in their 40s and had long tried to have children.  After much prayer 
they finally had a baby boy.  The Parks understandably treasured their 
baby, and soon it was time for his first birthday.  Kisun bought a small 
toy in spite of his limited budget to visit them.  When he arrived at the 
Parks&#146; house he found something was wrong.  He knocked on the door 
but no one answered.  The house was silent and there was no response to 
his greeting.  He opened the door and entered the room to find Mr. Park 
sitting alone with his face to the wall.  On the white wall was a cross 
drawn clearly with blood.  Shocked by this sight, he asked Mr. Park, 
&quot;What happened?&quot;  Mr. Park told him that the baby died last 
night.  The baby had a high fever so they took him to the doctor.  But 
door was locked shut, and when they took the baby to another doctor, he 
was out on his rounds.  The first-time parents had no idea what to do; 
they broke down crying.  Eventually they took him home and returned to a 
doctor early next morning, but it was too late.  The baby died of 
pneumonia.  Kisun did not have a word to say.  The baby they had so 
longed for died on his first birthday.  Mr. Park was weeping and said, 
&quot;Pastor, now I understand the pain of losing one&#146;s only child, 
just as God lost his only son to the cross to save us from sin.&quot;  
Kisun prayed for God&#146;s comfort and blessing and left.  Later he 
heard that Mrs. Park got pregnant again, and much later he learned that 
the couple had three children who all grew up healthy.  Kisun thanked and 
praised God for this good news.</P>

<B><P>The Potato Field</P>
</B>

<P>As the war intensified, the food situation deteriorated.  In the
cities everything was rationed by the government.  Portions of daikon
and rice mixed with &quot;junk&quot; grains were distributed, but with
still not enough to feed their families, mothers would be seen making
trips to the countryside with large backpacks to buy produce directly
from the farms.  The seminary fortunately owned land, so we cultivated
different kinds of crops on it, and we did not go hungry.  One time,
when I was standing inside a train, a man sitting in front of me
suddenly touched my leg and said loudly, &quot;She&#146;s nice and
plump.  They should decrease her rations!&quot; My face turned red
with embarrassment, but actually I was rather fat because I was eating
a lot of potatoes.</P>

<P>My father took the initiative himself cultivating the land.  The
students also worked very hard.  They planted pumpkins, potatoes,
sweet potatoes, daikon, tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, green onions,
wheat, etc.  Later they used a neighbor&#146;s land to expand their
farming.  Because the neighbor lived in the city, he agreed to accept
a percentage of the sweet potato crop as payment for the land use.  At
harvest time, Kisun accompanied my mother to the neighbor&#146;s plot.
He began to dig out the best-looking potatoes, when my mother told him
to leave the best to the landlord.  But he said, &quot;It&#146;s okay.
We are the ones who labored to grow these potatoes,&quot; and kept
digging.  Then my father came and shouted at my mother, &quot;What are
you doing?  Didn&#146;t I tell you to leave the best for the landlord?
Is this what Christians are supposed to do?  Aren&#146;t you ashamed
to let such things happen while you watched?&quot; My mother bowed and
replied, &quot;Yes, I am sorry, it&#146;s my fault.&quot; Kisun felt
like crawling into a hole.  My father was quite strict about such
things.  Through these personal experiences Kisun learned about my
father&#146;s interpretation of the Bible, about his faith, and about
how a person dedicated to God should live his life.  Then he tried to
put them into practice in his own life.</P>

<B><P>Our First Encounter</P>
</B>

<P>Our house and the seminary dormitory were on the same lot, so my 
younger brother often went to play in the dorm.  One day my brother told 
me, &quot;There&#146;s a new student--Kawamoto-san.  He&#146;s so neat 
that he makes sure even the books on his desk are always at the right 
angle.  On his wall is a sign he posted that says, &#145;Goal: 5000 books 
read!&#146;  But he&#146;s funny, too.  When I told him I was returning 
(<I>kaeru</I>), he said, &#145;What?  Tetsuo-san is a frog 
(<I>kaeru</I>)?&#146;  Oh, and another time when I told him that we were 
all going out in a boat, he said, &#145;Is your older sister going?  
I&#146;m afraid the boat might sink.&#146;&quot;  I was furious and told 
my brother to tell him that my weight was none of his business.</P>

<P>Since there were few students left in the dormitory at this time,
their meals were prepared in our house and brought to them in the
dorm.  One time when I went to the dorm and called out, &quot;The
meals are here,&quot; it was Kisun who came out to get them.  My first
impression was of a tall, slim man with big eyes.  After that I
happened to run into him on my way to and from school a few times.
Once we happened upon each other at the train station, and we walked
back together.  He said that he wanted to talk with me in a quiet
place, so we went to a small park.  As we sat on a bench he told me a
long story about his upbringing, his anguish for his country, and how
he decided to devote himself to God.  Then he proposed to me.  I could
not say anything, because it was so sudden and out of the blue.  I was
still a student and I could not take the idea of marriage seriously.
I did not say a word about it to my mother when I went home.  But
later he told my mother about his proposal.  My mother asked me,
&quot;Kawamoto-san told me that he proposed to you.  Why haven&#146;t
you said anything?&quot; Although I replied, &quot;I can&#146;t even
think of marrying him right now,&quot; after that I couldn&#146;t help
thinking about him.  If it is God&#146;s will I must marry him, but
how do I know if it is God&#146;s will or not?  Would I have said yes
if he were Japanese?  Previously I only had vague ideas about what kind
of man I wanted to marry.  A Christian who was intelligent and taller
than me, I supposed.  Kisun certainly met these criteria, but did I
have to go to some strange, far-away country without even knowing his
personality or character?  I prayed for an answer every day, but still
did not know.</P>

<P>Soon I was in my final year in high school, and had to make a
decision about what to do after graduation.  The air raids on the
major cities were growing more intense, and refugees flocked to the
countryside.  At school, we were kept busy with fire-fighting training
and with menial labor for the war effort.  Even after graduation,
those not continuing their education or without a proper job would be
conscripted to work in the military factories.  I wanted to continue
my studies, but I knew it was impossible for me to go to college
because my two older brothers were already in college through
scholarships, and there would be no money for me as a girl.  So I
chose to go to a state-run teacher&#146;s school, which was
tuition-free.  I chose the one in Kakogawa, because a cousin already
lived there, and it was too rural to become a target for bombing.  It
was a relatively new school with poor facilities, and there was more
farm work involved than studying.  Students from the cities were
teased and hazed for not having the physical strength and know-how for
farm work.  Simply watering the big pumpkin field was very hard work,
since we had to carry bucketfuls of water by hand.  My shoulders would
start hurting, then eventually would go beyond pain to a kind of
numbness, and my legs would just keep moving on their own
mechanically.  The sun scorched our skins, our throats would become
parched.  We were told to think only of the soldiers fighting on the
front.  In winter we had to cut grass, which we stacked with human
manure and lime, to make organic fertilizer.  Through all this I was
still thinking about my marriage.  I had asked my mother to turn down
his proposal, but my mother told me not to take it so lightly and to
pray more.  I prayed for God to show me the right way, that I would do
whatever and go wherever He wished.  Then the words, &quot;If you want
to follow me, you carry your own cross and follow,&quot; came to my
mind.  Was my marriage going to be the cross that I would have to
bear?  Going to an unknown land, unknown language and customs, a
faraway land, and Japan about to lose the war, knowing nothing about
his family...  But if, if this is God&#146;s will, then I must follow.
I was not mature enough to know about the real world or about love;
psychologically, I was still a child.  I am a rather easy-going person
who is not especially sensitive to others&#146; needs.  Even now I
still wonder why he liked an overweight, not particularly pretty girl
like me.  Once my mother asked him, &quot;What would you do if Shoko
died?&quot;  He replied, &quot;Then I would marry her bones.&quot;  It
was true that I was moved to hear this.  Anyone who could love me so
much might make a good husband after all.</P>

<P>When I went home to visit, my mother said, &quot;I made up my mind to 
give you up to God.  You are my oldest daughter so I had my own dreams 
for you, but I came to realize that I should offer the best to God.  
Kawamoto-san told me that he fasted and prayed about this in the 
meantime.  What about you?  You should give an answer either way.  He is 
going back to Korea after graduation.  Your father thinks that he will go 
on to accomplish a lot.&quot;  So I agreed to the marriage and returned 
to school.  Several days later a letter arrived from my second oldest 
brother.  It said, &quot;I heard about your marriage to Kawamoto, but I 
object to it.  Are you sure that you could marry a foreigner and go to a 
faraway country?  Did you hear God&#146;s voice clearly like Joan of 
Arc?&quot;  His letter shook my resolve.  I returned home at once and 
told my father about this, and asked him what I should do.  He told me, 
&quot;You may not understand because your faith is still young.  But your 
mother and I believe this is God&#146;s will.  In the Old Testament, 
Joshua was commanded to cross a Jordan River that was so flooded that no 
one could have possibly forded it.  But when he took the first step into 
the river believing in God, the water receded.  So have faith and take 
that first step.  I truly believe that God will clear a path for 
you.&quot;  Then the three of us prayed together and I made up my 
mind.</P>

<P>In the book that my father wrote, it says, &quot;Brother Kawamoto had 
heard the call to return to Korea as a missionary, but before he left he 
proposed to my oldest daughter.  In those uncertain times nobody wanted 
to let her go to Korea; we could not be sure if we would ever see her 
again.  But I always felt guilt toward Korea, so I thought it would be 
good if I gave up my daughter for Korea.  I kept praying for God&#146;s 
will to be done, and gradually the others changed their minds, and the 
couple themselves came to an agreement.  So Kawamoto and my daughter had 
a simple wedding ceremony at my house, then they left for Korea.</P>

<B><P>Marriage</P>
</B>

<P>In April 1945, I had just started my second year at the teacher&#146;s 
school.  Almost every day the cities were attacked by air, and most men 
were drafted and sent to battle.  There were few laborers left, so we 
were sent to work in a factory at Akashi.  Our job was filing metal 
sheets to make them smooth.  The sheets were used to make lids for 
airplane oil tanks.  Even a bit of unevenness could cause a leak, so 
precision work was required.  The fact that unskilled students were doing 
this kind of job showed how desperate the situation was for Japan at the 
time, but we only did our work and never spoke about it.</P>

<P>One day, Kisun and my father came to inform my school that I would
be leaving.  After they left, the principal, concerned about me,
asked, &quot;I heard that you are going to marry and go to Korea, but
do you think it&#146;s all right to go there at such a difficult time?
I think you will face a lot of hardship--are you ready for that?&quot;
I told him that I had decided after a lot of thinking.  Then I packed
my belongings and left school.  A week later we had the wedding
ceremony at my house.  Both of us wore the extremely plain, prescribed
wartime civilian clothing.  We could not afford pictures, so we have
no wedding photos.</P>

<P>Upon returning from our honeymoon, my father told my husband,
&quot;I let my daughter marry you not to work for Japan but for Korea,
so you go back to Korea as soon as possible.&quot; We packed our
summer clothes, two pots, chopsticks, spoons, rice, miso, dried
seaweed, and some other foods in our backpack, and left for Korea.
The reality of being married had not yet sunk in, and it felt like I
was just going on a short trip, so I did not even pack my winter
clothes, thinking I would return soon to fetch them.  But it would be
five years before I would be able to return home again.</P>

<B><P>Seoul</P>
</B>

<P>The boat to Korea was packed with people, and everybody was tense with 
fear of being attacked by enemy submarines.  Occasionally, boats would be 
sunk by torpedoes.  We took my husband&#146;s nephew (his oldest 
brother&#146;s oldest son--about my age) with us to let him study in 
Seoul.</P>

<P>It was early May when we arrived in Seoul.  We began our new life in a 
tiny room rented from a Korean.  It was a hard job to start a coal fire 
for cooking.  It took me hours just to cook rice and miso soup with seaweed.  
Since we didn&#146;t have any plates or bowls, the first meal that I 
cooked for us we ate directly from the cooking pots.  But the meal tasted 
good to us, and we ate everything in the pots.  The landlady was an 
author, who wrote serialized novels for newspapers.  She had three 
children; the oldest was a freshman in high school, who taught me Korean.  
But it was children&#146;s language, so when I tried out what I had just 
learned on my husband, it made him laugh.</P>

<P>After a while, the landlady&#146;s family evacuated to the country, so 
we were able to use the whole house.  However, we still had hardly any 
furniture or housewares.</P>

<P>It was almost at the end of the war, and the Japanese police watched 
any public activity very closely.  It was very hard for us to evangelize 
in this situation, so we decided to bide our time.  I spent entire days 
studying Korean.  At least I wanted to be able to sing hymns in Korean 
during worship services.  Finally, on August 15, Japan surrendered 
unconditionally, and the long, terrible war was over.  Korea was once 
again an independent nation.  The city of Seoul was filled with Korean 
flags and people shouted with joy.  I felt relief rather than sadness at 
Japan&#146;s defeat, but still I could not help crying all day.  The 
neighbors who spoke kindly to me before suddenly turned cold and would 
not even greet me anymore.  We saw many Japanese settlers evacuating from 
Manchuria and northern Korea, and heading back to Japan in shabby clothes 
without any belongings.</P>

<P>At that time my husband was being recruited by a newly formed 
political party to join their central committee.  Hearing of his refusal, 
one early morning the wife of the party leader visited us and tried to 
persuade him.  For a while he wavered, but in prayer he reaffirmed his 
commitment to God&#146;s work, and not to get involved in politics.  Then 
we started to pray every night for a path to open up, so that we might 
begin our ministry here.</P>

<P>One day as he was strolling aimlessly in a rich residential area, he 
found a small Japanese temple.  He thought how wonderful it would be if 
he could have such a place to start a church.  He almost passed the 
temple, but then he thought God might have led him here, so he entered 
the temple.  An old priest came out to greet him.  When he saw my 
husband, he said in trembling voice, &quot;As you can see, I&#146;m just 
a priest and have done nothing wrong.  I don&#146;t know why you came, 
but please do not be cruel to an old man.&quot;  He bowed and rubbed his 
hands together in prayer.  These were days when the Japanese were hiding 
behind closed doors for fear of retaliation by the Koreans.  My husband 
told him gently and politely in Japanese not to worry, and the priest 
showed him inside the temple.</P>

<P>The temple had a large room that could have seated 150 people.  My 
husband told him that he was a pastor and was looking for a place to 
start a church.  The priest listened to him and said that, even though 
their religions were different, he would be happy to see the temple used 
to help people.  The price was 20,000 yen, which was the cost of a large 
house in Seoul at the time.  In fact, we had received 20,000 yen as a 
wedding gift from my husband&#146;s older brother, who owned a business 
in Manchuria.  So he thanked God and purchased the temple.</P>

<P>On the first Sunday of October, we had our first worship service in
this remodeled temple.  There were only three people--my husband, his
nephew, and I.</P>
