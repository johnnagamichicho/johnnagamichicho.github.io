301.<br>
Ben Franklin was shocked one dark night<br>
As he flew, in a storm, his small kite.<br>
The lightning flashed--<i>ZING!</i>--<br>
To the end of the string<br>
And the key from a can of SPAM Lite.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

302.<br>
MSB once was taken aback<br>
When he found he'd forgotten to pack<br>
SPAM meat, KY gel<br>
And Kleenex.  <i>"Oh, hell!<br>
Now what will I do in the sack?"</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

303.<br>
These sex acts of which people write<br>
In SPAMku on John Cho's web site:<br>
Are they due to SPAM pork<br>
Needing a good fork<br>
And some folks not hearing that right?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

304.<br>
An infamous gourmand named Jack<br>
Had a rather unsavory knack<br>
Of spreading sliced SPAM<br>
With strawberry jam<br>
Which he ate, between meals, as a snack.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

305.<br>
If it's SPAMericks you want, I'm your man!<br>
But aesthetics just ain't in my plan.<br>
There's no time to refine;<br>
Like a vast assembly line,<br>
I just churn out the stuff, like SPAM cans!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

306.<br>
Right now, I'm a miserable hack<br>.
But <i>one</i> day they'll put up a plaque<br>
Saying "Here lived Geoff Holme<br>
Who wrote many a poem<br>
About SPAM, in a room at the back."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

307.<br>
Although my name's found under these<br>
SPAM verses, I'd like, if you please,<br>
To ask for your pardon.<br>
You see, I'm no bard 'n'<br>
They're translations from Mandarin Chinese.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

308.<br>
"...News just in--and loose on the street<br>
Is a psycho, obsessed with pork meat.<br>
Although he's quite manic<br>
There's no need to panic<br>
Unless he gets more SPAM to eat."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

309.<br>
Said the shivering student who swam<br>
Down an icy cold stretch of the Cam,<br>
Dressed in just underwear,<br>
"I'd n-n-normally not d-dare,<br>
But the f-f-forfeit's to eat a whole SPAM!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

310.<br>
A vegan from southern Belize<br>
Held the notion that SPAM grew on trees.<br>
But her dish was not eaten;<br>
Her guests started to threaten<br>
That they would shoot more than the breeze!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

311.<br>
A Cubist is someone who sees<br>
Things in ways which cause some folks unease.<br>
Like Picasso or Braque,<br>
His perception's off whack--<br>
Offer SPAM and he's sure to say "Please!".<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

312.<br>
This rejection slip came from the SHAM--<br>
"Re the poems in your telegram:<br>
To be blunt, if you'll pardon,<br>
They're just too avant garde 'n'<br>
There's not enough reference to SPAM."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

313.<br>
To Miss Piggy Popeye said, "My dear Ma'am,<br>
I am what I eat, that I am."<br>
Then rendering Miss Piggy<br>
From her hooves to her wig, he<br>
Claimed I am what was ham, I am SPAM.<br>
<address>--J. Hayek</address><p>

314.<br>
A middle-aged man from Xinjiang<br>
Once tried SPAM then began this harangue:<br>
"It's O.K. as a snack<br>
But my aphrodisiac<br>
Is a bubbling soup of <i>trepang</i>!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

315.<br>
A marine life researcher named Pawson<br>
Attended a screening of <i>Jaws</i> 'n'<br>
Came up with a plan<br>
To smear greasy SPAM<br>
On the parts that a shark usually gnaws on.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

316.<br>
Raise your glasses in wild celebration!<br>
I've received a prestigious citation<br>
Thanks to my many fans!<br>
I'm now <i>Laureate of SPAM</i><br>
With a grant from the Hormel Foundation!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

317.<br>
A psycho SPAM eater named Walker<br>
Was obsessed with Miss Piggy.  He'd stalk her<br>
By day and by night<br>
To catch a brief sight<br>
Of that steatopygous young porker!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

318.<br>
I once put a small SPAM gift pack<br>
On the monitor of my Apple Mac<br>
To promote inspiration.<br>
But it led to frustration--<br>
Thick, grey smoke and the screen turning black.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

319.<br>
A literary critic named Dawson,<br>
With his boy, took a short, one-day course on<br>
<i>Edward Lear's Limerick Rhymes</i>.<br>
"He repeats his first lines!<br>
And no mention of SPAM--what a flaw, son!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

320.<br>
A builder from Ames, Oklahoma<br>
Spent thirty-six weeks in a coma.<br>
He'd been hit by some lumber<br>
But was roused from his slumber<br>
By a whiff of SPAM meat's vile aroma.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

321.<br>
To cure her addiction to SPAM, a<br>
Girl from Mobile, Alabama<br>
Tied herself at the knees<br>
To a circus trapeze<br>
And hit her own head with a hammer.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

322.<br>
She'd once been a fine bare-back rider<br>
But her belly got wider and wider.<br>
The problem--you guessed!--<br>
Was putting the best<br>
Part of five cans of SPAM meat inside her.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

323.<br>
"Right!  That's it!  Stop right there!", bellowed Nils<br>
As he rehearsed his act with the seals.<br>
"You won't do what I wish<br>
So I'll swap all these fish<br>
For SPAM.  We'll just see how <i>that</i> feels!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

324.<br>
On the high-wire, Dmitri was set<br>
For a back flip but started to sweat.<br>
"SPAM for lunch!  I feel YUCK!<br>
And I gotta upchuck<br>
But I'm up here with no safety net!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

325.<br>
As Jolene put her head in the jaws<br>
Of a lion, to thunderous applause,<br>
She laughed, since she knew<br>
That, with her SPAM shampoo,<br>
There's no danger until she withdraws.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

326.<br>
In the slapstick routine, Max the Clown<br>
Developed a deep, pensive frown.<br>
He'd started to think<br>
Why SPAM goes in pink<br>
And comes out a light shade of brown.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

327.<br>
All day long I do what people ask;<br>
I'm transformed when I don this pink mask.<br>
The worst of the curse is<br>
I churn out SPAM verses<br>
Dressed in boots, fish net tights, and silk basque!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

328.<br>
Dear Geoff Holme, I've just read your piece<br>
All about a young Vietnamese.<br>
Please cut out this crap!<br>
Signed, A Member of SLAP<br>
(SPAM Limerick Aesthetics Police)<br>
<address>--SLAP Head</address><p>

329.<br>
That renowned SPAMophile Geoffrey Holme<br>
Is a dab hand at penning a polme.<br>
With his pink porky rhymes<br>
He enjoys some great times,<br>
Now his SPAMericks would fill a large tolme.<br>
<address>--David Pawson</address><p>

330.<br>
I am truly amazed at the internet scam;<br>
Nothing is sacred--not even SPAM.<br>
It breaks my heart<br>
Reading limericks by part,<br>
But I'm laughing out loud, God damn!!<br>
<address>--Janie Miller</address><p>

331.<br>
A friend of mine (let's call her "Gert")<br>
Asked her dinner host, "What's for dessert?"<br>
"Would <i>you</i> like to try<br>
SPAM and corn syrup pie?"<br>
I won't say where she hit--but it hurt.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

332.<br>
Just last week, as I slid from the wheel<br>
Of my SPAM colored automobile,<br>
I was mobbed by a gang<br>
Of SPAM limerick fans:<br>
Adulation is hard to conceal!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

333.<br>
So, I'm taking this chance to reveal<br>
Just how utterly privileged I feel.<br>
I got where I am<br>
Thanks to God, Mom and SPAM--<br>
And pandering to popular appeal.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

334.<br>
Here's a recipe sure to excite<br>
Your taste buds!  Take 2 cups of Lite<br>
SPAM meat that's been diced,<br>
4 red onions, sliced,<br>
And marinate it all overnight...<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

335.<br>
...In a large tumblerful of Cointreau.<br>
Then cover it all in firm dough.<br>
Bake it slowly, then mash,<br>
Throw it all in the trash<br>
And order a pizza to go!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

336.<br>
An IRS clerk named Emil<br>
Is allergic to pork meat but he'll<br>
Scream out, "OH YES! I LOVE IT!!"<br>
When you take SPAM and shove it<br>
Where the sun does not shine, while he kneels.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

337.<br>
My cartoon strip hero, Dilbert,<br>
Always wears a white, short-sleeved shirt.<br>
To diffuse the grim scent<br>
Of SPAM Deodorant--<br>
All-day action from one little squirt!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

338.<br>
When my comic strip hero, Dilbert,<br>
Was attacked with SPAM he was unhurt.<br>
But he wears a blank stare<br>
'Cos it spiked up his hair<br>
And caused his best tie to invert.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

339.<br>
A sweet, gentle girl named Lucille<br>
Was always refined and genteel<br>
Until her brunch host<br>
Served up fried SPAM on toast...<br>
Her life sentence is under appeal.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

340.<br>
<b>"Yes, it's true, I admit, I do crave<br>
After SPAM; but to it I'm no slave.<br>
I eat three cans a day<br>
But I <i>could</i> quit, O.K.?"</b><br>
Were the words that they put on his grave.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

341.<br>
If I had my time over again,<br>
To avoid all the sorrow and pain,<br>
I d be more kind and gentle,<br>
Not so temperamental;<br>
But I'd <i>still</i> treat SPAM meat with disdain.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

342.<br>
Dear Geoff Holme, This is SLAP Head again.<br>
The IRS are fine guys, in the main.<br>
To imply that they use<br>
SPAM meat for abuse<br>
Is a slur.  They phoned SLAP to complain.<br>
<address>--SLAP Head</address><p>

343.<br>
See guys weep as their life's work disperses<br>
And the air turning blue with their curses:<br>
I changed my name to "Boringe,"<br>
(An exact rhyme for <i>orange</i>);<br>
Now my fame's spread beyond just <i>SPAM</i> verses.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

344.<br>
A young college student named Kirsty<br>
Said that she felt enormously thirsty.<br>
"Ate more SPAM than I oughta!<br>
Too much salt!!  Pass the water!!!"<br>
She kept drinking till her bladder burst!  Gee!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

345.<br>
Spare a thought for those poor Japanese<br>
Soldiers still hiding out in the trees<br>
Of the western Pacific.<br>
Still, it must be terrific:<br>
No sex scandals, smog or SPAM!  Jeez!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

346.<br>
My doctors say thinking in rhyme<br>
Isn't good for someone past his prime.<br>
If I waste one more day<br>
Writing SPAMericks, they say<br>
That they don't give me very much time...<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

347.<br>
...Their advice is complete rest in bed,<br>
With <i>no</i> rhymes to bother my head.<br>
"Keep your mind totally blank--<br>
Watch fish swim in a tank<br>
Or just stick to SPAMku instead."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

348.<br>
More than 100 SPAMericks from me!<br>
But there's still more to do yet.  You see<br>
I'm determined I'm gonna<br>
Outperform Mike O'Connor<br>
(In number, if not quality).<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

349.<br>
Dear John Cho, I beseech you--ignore<br>
If Dave Pawson submits any more.<br>
It just wouldn't be right as<br>
He stalks limerick writers<br>
And, like SPAM meat, it sticks in my craw!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

350.<br>
A Natural History curator<br>
In a restaurant yelled out to the waiter,<br>
"The fly that just swam<br>
In my soup's on my SPAM!<br>
Now it's dead--gone to meet the Creator."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

351.<br>
A Chinese pork lover named Tsui<br>
Brought home SPAM to his house in St. Louis.<br>
Now his dog won't stop baying<br>
And his poor wife is praying<br>
For a way to restore their feng shui.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

352.<br>
The Old World map-maker, Mercator,<br>
Was notorious as a masturbator.<br>
He'd a strong predilection<br>
To crank his "projection."<br>
(Abusing SPAM meat came much later...)<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

353.<br>
Shakespeare wrote <i>all</i> those plays?  You're mistaken.<br>
My research shows that some came from Bacon.<br>
A word search of <i>Hamlet</i><br>
Finds no reference to SPAM, yet<br>
My belief in this theory's unshaken.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

354.<br>
Though the powers that be try to appease,<br>
JFK theorists still feel unease.<br>
Claims, conjectures, suggestions!<br>
Now to add to the questions:<br>
<i>Who smeared SPAM grease on young Michael's skis?</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

355.<br>
Said the priest, to the future in-laws,<br>
"Can anyone here show just cause<br>
Why these two should not wed?"<br>
<i>"Yes!  He'll take SPAM to bed<br>
And indulge in abuse while she snores!"</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

356.<br>
Indulging in SPAM has destroyed a<br>
Pleasure that you once enjoyed, uh?<br>
Hormel shows no restraint,<br>
They'll deride your complaint:<br>
A case of acute <i>schadenfreude</i>!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

357.<br>
The night rings in my home town of Lancing<br>
With SPAM barbecues, singing and dancing.<br>
It's one vast jamboree--<br>
I beat mickman's P.B.<br>
<i>And my output's still daily advancing!</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

358.<br>
Whilst playing a tune by Berlin<br>
A splinter got stuck in my chin.<br>
The wound was infected<br>
But now I'm protected<br>
By SPAM stuck to my violin.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

359.<br>
If you look past the marketing spiel,<br>
A review of the facts will reveal<br>
Hormel's flagrant conceit:<br>
SPAM's no "miracle meat"--<br>
It's not fit to adorn <i>any</i> meal.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

360.<br>
My predicament's quite problematical.<br>
Some guys think that I am fanatical<br>
When it comes down to SPAM:<br>
Should I stay as I am<br>
Or indulge in a well-earned sabbatical?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

361.<br>
God worked several days and was glad;<br>
On the next he made SPAM and was sad.<br>
"It's not up to my best.<br>
Should have taken a rest...<br>
Still, six out of seven ain't bad!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

362.<br>
My microwave oven is screwy!<br>
It works fine if I heat up chop suey<br>
Mixed with fried beef or ham.<br>
But if I add diced SPAM,<br>
Sparks will fly and the whole thing turns gooey...<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

363.<br>
...So I phoned up the makers, Matsui,<br>
And got this from a young man named Hughie:<br>
"You're the sixth one today!<br>
SPAM's the problem, OK?<br>
Try it raw mixed with cold ratatouille."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

364.<br>
A SPAM meat abuser overcame<br>
His thoughts of self-loathing and shame<br>
When he happened to find<br>
That he'd <i>really</i> gone blind.<br>
He sent in a damages claim.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

365.<br>
Hormel, flatly denying all blame<br>
For the tragedy, tried to disclaim<br>
Liability.  Excuse?<br>
<i>"It was product misuse."</i><br>
But they'd ten other suits all the same!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

366.<br>
The blind monkey spanker became<br>
More annoyed until he was aflame<br>
With a burning desire<br>
To give vent to his ire<br>
By sullying Hormel's good name.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

367.<br>
So he started a national campaign<br>
To publicize how SPAM can maim.<br>
He wrote SPAM poetry,<br>
Which he read on T.V.,<br>
And thus greatly enhanced his own fame.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

368.<br>
Hormel's lawyers set out to reclaim<br>
The reputation he'd tried to defame.<br>
They began a suit where<br>
They hoped they could declare<br>
Their opponent completely insane.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

369.<br>
"Hormel's case is weak, shallow and lame,"<br>
The trial judge was heard to exclaim.<br>
"SPAM's a threat to society!<br>
I won't let my wife buy it!" he<br>
Cried.  "A complete ban's my aim!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

370.<br>
The judgment received wide acclaim.<br>
And that's how those lawyers all came<br>
To be thrown on skid row.<br>
Now the victor, John Cho,<br>
Runs this web site--another ball-game.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

371.<br>
I sing of a product named SPAM<br>
Made up, so they say, out of ham.<br>
They mush it 'til mushy<br>
And squoosh it 'til squooshy<br>
And jam-pack it into a can.<br>
<address>--Michael Devine, kenobi@leland.stanford.edu</address><p>

372.<br>
My dear little nephew, aged four,<br>
Loves the seaside; he likes nothing more<br>
Than to run, paddle and<br>
Build vast castles of sand<br>
With a SPAM can he found on the shore.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

373.<br>
Dear Geoff Holme, an encouraging sign!<br>
Your last entry was quite anodyne--<br>
No smutty SPAM jokes<br>
At the cost of the folks<br>
At Hormel whom you usually malign.<br>
<address>--SLAP Head</address><p>

374.<br>
My Inuit friend will not freeze.<br>
He rubs rancid SPAM grease on his knees,<br>
Ears, elbows, and nose<br>
When the cold north wind blows<br>
And the weather drops 50 degrees.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

375.<br>
"Arma virumque cano"<br>
Is just one Latin verse that I know.<br>
In 2000 years time<br>
Just how many a rhyme<br>
About SPAM will be still apropos?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

376.<br>
A poor Indian man named Aziz<br>
Eats meals made with rice and chickpeas<br>
Or some other gram.<br>
But he will not touch SPAM<br>
Though it costs not many rupees.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

377.<br>
Another poor man from New Delhi<br>
Rubs slimy SPAM gel on his belly<br>
To keep off the flies.<br>
But, until it dries,<br>
It's slippery, cold, and quite smelly.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

378.<br>
Sir Geoffrey "The Laureate" Holme<br>
Compiled a magnificent tome<br>
Of SPAMericks he wrote<br>
On an old upturned boat<br>
By the shores of his ancestral home.<br>
<address>--Mike O'Connor (K.M.O'Connor), mickman@intonet.co.uk</address><p>

379.<br>
So mickman returns to the fray!<br>
I thought you had no more to say<br>
About SPAM in verse form.<br>
You took SPAMericks by storm<br>
Then your output just faded away.<br> 
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

380.<br>
It's clear from your last communique:<br>
Its style, tone, and content betray<br>
Complete veneration<br>
Of my imposing station<br>
As Hormel's U.K. SPAM attache.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

381.<br>
In the remotest of chambers in Hell<br>
Old mickman complained of the smell<br>
Of computer corruption<br>
And spontaneous combustion<br>
When Sir Geoffrey left SPAM in the cell.<br>
<address>--Mike O'Connor (K.M.O'Connor), mickman@intonet.co.uk</address><p>

382.<br>
Just last night I received a great shock<br>
When I looked up and glanced at the clock.<br>
I'd spent the whole day<br>
With nothing to say<br>
About SPAM: a complete writer's block!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

383.<br>
After 36 hours in a tank<br>
Of SPAM gel, my mind was a blank:<br>
My skin started peeling,<br>
I had no sense of feeling,<br>
I was deaf, dumb and blind--and I stank.<br>

<i>Captain's Log, Supplemental:</i> It seems<br>
That a force in the transporter beams<br>
Has attacked Mr Spock.<br>
He appears in deep shock,<br>
Crying, "Look out!  It's SPAM!!"  between screams.<br>

On All Hallow's Eve at midnight<br>
Witches from far and wide reunite.<br>
They each hold a can<br>
Of foul, fetid SPAM,<br>
Which they use in some devilish rite.<br>

A weary old Scotsman named Jock,<br>
After years hunting Nessie, said "Och,<br>

To watch hour after hour.<br>
Flush him oot: drop raw SPAM in the loch!"<br>

My worst dream?  I'm employed as a plumber<br>
In the sweltering heat of mid-summer<br>
In the heart of the city,<br>
Clearing drains blocked with gritty,<br>
Stale, rancid, foul SPAM...  What a bummer!<br>

I feel sick, my hands tremble, knees knock<br>
My mistake was to use my new wok<br>
To make SPAM stir-fry.<br>
Now my throat's sore and dry<br>
And I'm sweating: Please call out the doc!<br>

When I started, I wrote just SPAMku;<br>
Now I find only SPAMericks will do.<br>
'Cos what you get with 'em<br>
Are rhyming and rhythm<br>
And there's more meat on which you can chew.<br>

My son's not as clever as some are.<br>

With <i>The Rock Band From Hell</i>.<br>
Now he works for Hormel<br>
Tasting SPAM.  Tell me--what could be dumber?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

391.<br>
In my list of words rhyming with "SPAM"<br>
I came across this one: <i>iamb</i>.<br>
It's a little scholastic;<br>
It would take something drastic<br>
To be useful outside an exam.<br>

There once was a french female,<br>

An army drill sergeant named Ray<br>

Ten miles out in full pack.<br>
But, on the way back,<br>
You'll have SPAM in your boots all the way!"<br>

"If that plane leaves the ground and you're not<br>
With him, you'll regret it.  Maybe not<br>
Today or tomorrow,<br>
But soon, with deep sorrow--<br>
We eat SPAM here, in case you forgot."<br>

Though people may sneer, laugh, and mock<br>
At my SPAM stash, I've built up a stock.<br>
I won't get in a swelter<br>
In my nuclear shelter<br>
If they restore the Communist bloc.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

396.<br>
In a run-down West Coast cabaret,<br>
The stand-up was really risque.<br>
His joke told of Clinton,<br>
Monica, Rin Tin Tin, 'n'<br>
SPAM meat in a motel ashtray.<br>

In a trailer park just outside Banff,<br>

She wrote off and requested<br>
A copy of Hitler's <i>Mein Kampf</i>.<br>

My aunt, who lives near St. Tropez,<br>
Was serving her SPAM Lite Puree<br>
When she slipped, dropped the dish.<br>
We ate <i>pommes frites</i> and fish.<br>
<i>(Yes--I'd polished her kitchen's parquet.)</i><br>

In a SPAM Cook-Off held outside Durban,<br>
A Sikh won first prize with his Herb 'n'<br>

He didn't use spice--<br>
Just two fingers of Kentucky bourbon.<br>

What made this feat so darn perturbin'<br>
Was the fact that it tasted superb 'n'<br>
They couldn't see how<br>
He'd made such great chow--<br>
<i>But he hid the SPAM under his turban!</i><br>
