Move backwards to <a href="limericks6.html">Numbers 501-600</a>.<p>

601. (May 6th)<br>
A Hormel spokesperson named Celia<br>
Says that now SPAM containers are steelier:<br>
In elliptical orbits,<br>
The cold, freezing hoar splits<br>
Thinner cans when they reach their <font
color="RED"><b>aphelia</b></font></i>.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

602. (May 7th)<br>
If you want to know what made young Bob sob,<br>
It began when he started to <font color="RED"><b>hobnob</b></font><br>
With those SPAM meat abusers:<br>
Not a path he'd now choose as<br>
It made his balls burn and his knob throb!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

603.<br>
There once was a young sow named Pam,<br>
Who had an affair with a Ram.<br>
The result of her sins<br>
Was pink meat in blue tins<br>
And the folks at Hormel called it SPAM.<br>
<address>--John Bassett</address><p>

604. (May 8th)<br>
When I made my Tabasco SPAM bake (a<br>
Simple gift for my neighbor, a Quaker)<br>
His <font color="RED"><b>irenic</b></font></i> tradition<br>
Overcame his suspicion.<br>
Now his soul is at rest in God's acre.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

605. (May 9th)<br>
Writing SPAMericks can be quite laborious<br>
And the time it takes up is notorious<br>
For its toll on one's marriage.<br>
But that shouldn't disparage<br>
My verses: they're all <font
color="RED"><b>meritorious</b></font></i>!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

606. (May 10th)<br>
Our friend is well known as a <font
color="RED"><b>gourmand</b></font></i>.<br>
He's a likeable guy but he sure stunned<br>
Us with his confession<br>
That his SPAM meat obsession<br>
Had caused him to plunder the poor fund.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

607. (May 11th)<br>
Shed a tear for my first cousin, Clyde:<br>
A large piece of SPAM Lite that he fried<br>
Lodged inside his esophagus.<br>
Now his engraved <font color="RED"><b>sarcophagus</b></font></i><br>
Warns the odd passer-by how he died.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

608. (May 12th)<br>
Penning haiku on SPAM or SPAM Lite?<br>
Count your syllables: make sure they're right!<br>
The SHAM, John N. Cho, kicks<br>
Anyone who is <font color="RED"><b>prolix</b></font></i><br>
Off his world-famous SPAMku web site.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

609. (May 13th)<br>
Though Hormel's main product is panned<br>
The management stand by their brand.<br>
But each time that a man dies<br>
It serves to <font color="RED"><b>aggrandize</b></font></i><br>
The case that SPAM meat should be banned.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

611. (May 14th)<br>
O frumious <font color="RED"><b><i>Bandersnatch</i></b></font>, pray<br>
Did you see a <i>Dormouse</i> pass this way,<br>
With a <i>Hare</i> and a <i>Hatter</i><br>
Bearing <i>SPAM</i> on a platter<br>
And a tea service on a large tray?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

612. (May 15th)<br>
I love quiet: my one greatest fear<br>
Is a loudmouth who bores me to tears.<br>
When I meet someone garrulous<br>
I feel so much more <font color="RED"><b>valorous</b></font><br>
With a plug of SPAM meat in each ear.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@tcam.com</address><p>

613.<br>
There was a young lady from Dallas<br>
Whose treatment of SPAM was callous.<br>
She'd open the can,<br>
Take the meat in her hand,<br>
And use it much like a phallus!<br>
<address>--dr soo dho nimh</address><p>

614.<br>
Across the desert, arid and bleak<br>
the wagon's axles started to squeak.<br>
The noise disturbed everyone's peace<br>
'cause they forgot to bring some grease.<br>
But a gob of SPAM was the best technique.<br>
<address>--Daniel Drzewiecki</address><p>

615.<br>

<address>--Mike O'Connor (K.M.O'Connor), mickman@intonet.co.uk</address><p>

Even my dog won't eat it!<br>

It's poor manners to eat and run--<br>

Hot day at the lake--I'm under a tarp.<br>

At the wedding reception the guests arrived<br>

<address>--Anonymous</address><p>

624.  (With apologies to Nantucket.)<br>

How could I help but up-chuck-it?<br>
<address>--Joan Andersen</address><p>

My cats Brandon and Squeek both like SPAM.<br>

And come running as fast as they can.<br>

And lick the inside of my can<br>
