A madman, obsessed by SPAM, screams,   "Stop me before I haiku
again.

Have you   ever noticed how some foods gain a fervent   following?

I'm not talking smoothies,   wraps or gingko-infused soft drinks.

Count   those as mere trends.

I'm talking about   those foods that would logically be   relegated
to a passing food fad, except that   when they get pushed to the back
of the   refrigerator they simply refuse to grow mold.    Then, before you
can say "spiced ham," a   subculture has taken root.

This   fascination with the salty pink luncheon meat   has gone way
beyond Monty Python's "Spam,   Spam, Spam, Spam" ditty.  It has
spawned Spam   Web sites, Spam memorabilia and Spam-ku:   Tranquil
Reflections on a Luncheon Loaf, a slim   book of haiku verse compiled
by (I'm not making   this up) Spam Haiku Archive Master John   Nagamichi
Cho.

Of course, Spam is not the   only food fetish out there.

Chiliheads,   those self-described heat-seeking hedonists who   enjoy
chugging volcanic hot sauces, could   certainly qualify as
card-carrying members of a   culinary subculture.  They get a rush from
the   molten sizzle the way folks who do extreme   sports might.

Dave DeWitt, a   self-described "Pope of Peppers," has made   it
his mission to spread the gospel according   to chili peppers.  The
author of The Chile   Pepper Encyclopedia, DeWitt has hooked many   a
chilihead.  As the founder of the National   Fiery Foods Show, an annual
convention in   Albuquerque, he has lit a fire under   incendiary
foodstuffs.

For that matter,   the Kansas City Barbeque Society is a   grassroots
organization that spreads its zany   love of barbecue around the world.

They   express their enthusiasm for their subject by   adopting alter
egos complete with nome de   grille.  A few might even don a pig   snout.

It's all good, clean fun.  But they are   devoted to their culinary
pursuits.

Instead of being manufactured by advertising   agencies and PR
firms, these food-related   movements tend to come from a   grass-roots
convergence and often seem to take   on a virtual life of their own.

Take   Marshmallow Peeps.  Two years ago it became   apparent to Just
Born, the makers of the spongy   marshmallow treats, that unofficial
Web sites   were puffing up sales.

Not all of it was   family entertainment, mind you.  Some folks   were
body-piercing the stretchy chicks and   displaying their photos in
electronic   galleries, while others were spinning them in a   centrifuge
and reporting the scientific   fallout.  The Just Born folks decided to
jump   on the bandwagon with the Official Marshmallow   Peeps Web site,
which premiered just before   Easter.

Who could have dreamed when Jell-O   was invented in the 1890s that
it would take on   such cultural significance that it could make   the
leap from instant dessert to quivering   icon?

I am fascinated by the endurance of   such foods and the passions
they ignite.

Only in America?

Maybe.

Ate three   cans of SPAM,

But there's still room for   Jell-O.

I love this country.
