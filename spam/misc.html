I like SPAM<br>
It is neat<br>
I can keep it on my feet<br>
When I want a bite to eat<br>
I just have to lick my feet<br>

SPAM<br>
O, ye of processed beef and/or pork and/or poultry<br>
That comes in a cool tin can<br>
That you open with a key<p>

That flops out in a fabulously perfect<br>
Preformed lump, all shining with<br>
Synthesized meat juices.<br>
Maybe.<p>

O, SPAM,<br>
With that great taste of non-meat.<br>
You cause my heart to speed, my knees to shake, and my skin to become clammy.<br>
You make me become short of breath, to convulse, and to have massive 
failures of the pancreas, arteries,<br>
And liver.<p>

And so in final salute to you, SPAM,<br>
My eternal God and King,<br>
Others can keep their Klik, Kam, and Spork,<br>
But I'll keep my SPAM.<br>
I just won't eat it.<br>

So, there it is.<br>
Plentiful in its own way.<br>
A monument to industrial society.<br>
Meat in a can, the sustainer of Man.<p>

A meal came from the heart.<br>

SPAM tastes like shit.<br>
It smells like a fat man's pit.<br>
Crap like that,<br>
is full of fat.<br>
My gay friend Jay<br>
eats SPAM all day<br> 
and we all think that is why he is gay.<br>
He starts to beat<br>
when he eats that meat.<br>
He gets more juice<br>
than a bitch in heat.<br>
He thinks that meat is squishy.<br>
He likes it more than pussy.<br>
He don't like chicks<br>
but he still sucks dicks<br>
and he eats his SPAM<br>
off old toothpicks.<br>
When it comes to SPAM<br>
he is a fan<br>
and he eats it when he's on the can.<br>
He eats it because he thinks it's soft.<br>
He squeezes it when he jacks off.<br>
He pulls it hard<br>
he squirts it clear<br>
and that is why we think he is queer!<p>

It's all your fault SPAM!!!!!<br>

<b>A Hymn To SPAM</b><p>

<em>"What is this stuff<br>
That doth jiggle in the breeze<br>
And smells like that which<br>
I avoid when I walk in the stables?"<br>
--Hysterics of Estrus</em><p>

O meaty mass of fleshy flesh<br>
Who with the dark and wild<br>
And wanton world doth mesh<br>
In sizzling ecstasy, tasty and mild!<p>

From the Ellay to the halls of Prism,<br>
To the salty fields of Elysium,<br>
Come to me glorious SPAM,<br>
Thou cooked, boiled, and pressed ham!<p>

IO SPAM!  IO SPAM!<br>
Come with eggs and toast,<br>
With bacon and duckling roast,<br>
Come wild!  Come sliced!<br>
Come mashed!  Come diced!<p>

IO SPAM!  SPAM!  IO!  IO!<br>
With this key thy veil I rend!<br>
Thy starry blue tin I twist and bend!<br>
That the thee in thee might<br>
Become the me in me tonight!<p>

And the thee in me I feel<br>
As the me in thee I peel;<br>
With glee and abandon I stab<br>
My trident into thy quivering flab!<br>
IO SPAM!  SPAM IO!  IO!  IO!<p>

With fervor and awe you relent<br>
Before my furious murderous intent;<br>
I whip I mash I slash I cream<br>
Thy body to consumate this dream.<br>
IO SPAM!  IO SPAM!  SPAM!  SPAM!  IO!  IO!<p>

I dice I beat I flake I shake<br>
I cover thee with Shake and Bake;<br>
SPAM!  O sweet sweet SPAM!<br>
Never again will I slam my ham!<br>

[In the style of M'ssrs Gilbert & Sullivan.]<p>

I now confess proclivity,<br>
For alimentativity,<br>
Involving parts ambiguous,<br>
Of that which once a piggy was.<p>

A cumulus gelatinous,<br>
Ingesting which will fatten us,<br>
And raise us to such ecstacy,<br>
That folks will crane their necks to see.<p>

This mottled pink comestible,<br>
Which most find indigestible,<br>
I find quite indispensible,<br>
And gorge 'til I'm insensible.<p>

So grab the can, examine it<br>
And if it says there's SPAM in it,<br>
Decant it to a plastic plate,<br>
Then fill your face and masticate.<br>

<b>Spammerwocky</b><p>

'Twas tiffin, and the gelid SPAM<br>
Sat glist'ning moistly on the Spode:<br>
All greasy was the noisesome reek<br>
On midday air bestowed.<p>

"Beware the acid reflux son!<br>
The fiery belch, the throat that stings!<br>
Beware the withering stares of those,<br>
Who find that pigs have wings"<p>

He took the proper fork in hand:<br>
Long time each gristly bite he chewed--<br>
A thought!  To spit it back on plate--<br>
He could not, it would be too rude.<p>

And as he pondered this faux pas,<br>
Regarding porcine jelly,<br>
A mighty belch, that seared like flame,<br>
Came rumbling from his belly.<p>

One chew, one chew and then you're through<br>
And top it with a Snickers snack.<br>
You think it down, but as you frown,<br>
It comes eructing back.<p>

<b>The SPAM of the Ancient Mariner</b><br>
<em>With apologies to Samuel Coleridge.</em><p>

[A wedding guest is accosted by a fearsome visitor.]<p>

It is an ancient Mariner,<br>
And he stoppeth one of three.<br>
"By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>
Oh wherefore stopp'st thou me?<p>

I am a guest at yonder feast,<br>
See how the plates are set<br>
With gourmet food and wine and cheese;<br>
No finer can'st thou get."<p>

He holds him with his skinny hand,<br>
"There was a ship," quoth he.<br>
"Hold off!  Unhand me, grey-beard loon!<br>
Oh who annoyeth me?"<p>

I've many names, the old man moaned;<br>
Crown Emperor of SPAM,<br>
Lucifer, Hell-bringer, Gill-Ee-Gan,<br>
But you can call me Sam.<p>

[The old man tells a strange story.]<p>

Now step right up and you will hear,<br>
A tale of a fateful trip;<br>
A tale of woe, I chanced to stow<br>
Aboard a Hormel ship.<p>

SPAM, SPAM everywhere,<br>
Sick putrid awful meat.<br>
SPAM, SPAM every where,<br>
Nor any bite to eat.<p>

I'll eat the pig, the Captain's pig!<br>
No SPAM for me but fresh roast pig.<br>
I'll feast tonight on suckling pig<br>
The freshest finest pig.<p>

[The upset crew hangs a talisman of evil around his neck.]<p>

You ate the pig, the Captain's pig!<br>
Oh fool, to eat our lucky pig.<br>
No pig to guide us to our port<br>
No hope to ever find our port,<br>
No port without our pig.<p>

Ah!  Well a-day!  What evil looks<br>
Had I from old and young!<br>
Instead of the cross, a small blue can<br>
Around my neck was hung.<p>

[The sailors abandon ship and leave him to his fate.]<p>

Alone, alone, all, all alone,<br>
Alone on a wide wide sea!<br>
A ship piled high with a ghastly load<br>
No crew, just SPAM and me.<p>

No loin, no roast, no tender chops,<br>
Not a single piece of meat;<br>
Just whiskers, hooves, the tail and snout<br>
were left for me to eat.<p>

The many pigs, so beautiful!<br>
And they on shore did lie;<br>
And a thousand thousand slimy lumps<br>
Sailed on; and so did I.<p>

[By the light of the moon, he sees SPAM in a new way.]<p>

The moving Moon rose up above,<br>
And lit the cans below.<br>
And in the cans, I thought I spied<br>
Soft light (by day must sunlight hide)<br>
A soft pink healthy glow.<p>

The self-same moment I could eat;<br>
And from my neck so free<br>
The can of SPAM fell off, and sank<br>
Like lead into the sea.<p>

[He safely reaches home to share the Good News about SPAM.]<p>

He eateth best, who loveth best<br>
All foods both great and small;<br>
For the dear God who loveth us,<br>
He made and eateth all.

"I do like SPAM," the guest proclaimed;<br>
"I'll eat it day and night:<br>
Yes I will eat it Sam-I-Am,<br>
Unhappy fearsome sight."<p>

He went like one that hath been stunned,<br>
And is of sense forlorn.<br>
Sadder yet not wiser: SPAM<br>
He ate the morrow morn.<br>

[With Apologies to Casey]<p>

It looked unappetizing as approached Thanksgiving night,<br>
Dinner was upon us with not a speck of SPAM in sight;<br>
With Sis gone vegetarian, and Dad's cholesterol so high,<br>
And Mom on a liquid diet to lose her cellulitic thighs.<p>

The menu was not even planned, no SPAM and cranberry stuffin',<br>
No casserole of marshmallowed SPAM;  no SPAM and walnut muffin;<br>
No honey-glazed, gelatinous mass; no cobblered SPAM and pumpkin,<br>
Realization hit me square, my grease-clogged heart was thumpin'!.<p>

There were no slices in the freezer (no need to freeze it, that is true);<br>
I searched all through the pantry, but there was not a can in view.<br>
I cursed the health food industry, wished death to Richard Simmons,<br>
And if Linus P. had been there I'd have sliced him into ribbons.<p>

The produce drawer was full of greens--arugula and cilantro;<br>
Low fat yogurt filled the shelves and on the door a mantra<br>
Exhorting all to eat their fish, "Have you had your grains today?;<br>
Your vitamins?  Your water?  Your roughage by the way?"<p>

I fled down to the basement, to where Dad kept the poison locked,<br>
I never ventured in before, the stuff after all, is toxic.<br>
I clawed through all the boxes hoping there to find<br>
Some very fatal substance, to end my life and ease my mind.<p>

Then as I groped a moldy carton, I felt a  feel familiar:<br>
It had the shape, the heft, the rim--I almost shouted Hallelujah!<br>
I dared to hope,  I closed my eyes, as from the murky depth<br>
I pulled out an old can of SPAM!  By God, I'm not bereft.<p>

But hidden there for all these years, would spoilage not have gotten<br>
Into the can, and made the "meat" more than its initial rotten?<br>
To peek?  To dare to dream?  What would this rusty tin reveal?<br>
Might it be the taste I long for?  Could therein lie a meal?<p>

There was daring in my manner, bravado in my stance,<br>
I read the the label lovingly--the preservatives gave a chance<br>
That though upstairs was healthy stuff, good all ills that ails,<br>
Inside perhaps was porcine pink beside which all else pales.<p>

And now the key is peeled off,  and now carefully I insert it,<br>
And gently (psst) unroll the seam, the contents not to hurt it;<br>
And now the top is opened and now the insides spilling out,<br>
And now the air is filled with scent of innard, foot and snout.<p>

Oh somewhere in some spa masseurs may muscle acids, tannic;<br>
In health foods stores across the land they label foods organic;<br>
And in nutrition classes fats are measured by the gram;<br>
But there's no joy like my stomach feels--I've lived and died for SPAM.<br>

[Apologies to Wm. Shakespeare and lovers of literature everywhere.]<p>

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<br>
I come to bury SPAM, not to praise it.<br>
The evil that SPAM does lives after it;<br>
The good is oft interred with its can.<br>
So let it be with SPAM.  The noble Brutus<br>
Hath told you SPAM was not nutritious;<br>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;<br>
And grievously hath SPAM answer'd it.<br>
Here under leave of Brutus and the rest--<br>
For Brutus is an honorable man;<br>
So are they all, all honorable men--<br>
Come I to speak in SPAM's funeral.<br>
It was my friend, nutritious and just to me;<br>
But Brutus says it is not nutritious;<br>
And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>
SPAM hath brought many tasty fried meals home to Rome;<br>
Whose fatty sustenance did the general stomachs fill;<br>
Did this in SPAM not seem nutritious?<br>
When that the poor have cried, SPAM hath seeped fat;<br>
Nutrition should be made of sterner stuff;<br>
Yet Brutus says it causes arteriosclerosis;<br>
And Brutus is an honorable man.<br>
You did all see that on the Lipidfest<br>
I thrice presented SPAM with a kingly crown,<br>
Which it did thrice refuse; was not this nutritious?<br>
Yet Brutus says it contributes to gastric distress;<br>
And, sure, he is an honorable man.<br>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
You all did love it once--not without cause;<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for it?<br>
O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason!--Bear with me,<br>
My arteries are in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>
And I must pause till circulation comes back to me.<br>

<b>SPAM Uncured</b><br>

<i>(With sincere apologies to Mr. Hughes and all who admire him)</i><P>

What happens to a SPAM uncured?<P>

Does it dry up<br>
like a raisin in the sun?<p>

Or sit in the store--<br>
covered with scum?<P>

Does it stink like genuine meat?<br>
Or crust and sugar over--<br>
like a syrupy sweet?<P>

Maybe it just quivers<br>
beneath a layer of mold<P>

Or does it just implode?<br>

<b>Amazing SPAM</b> (A Hymn)<p>

Amazing SPAM, how great thou art<br>
To feed a wench like me.<br>
I once was starved but now I'm full, <br>
T'was on account of thee!<p>

On many camping trips I'd gone<br>
And run slap out of food <br>
Until I learned to carry those tins<br>
O SPAM!  Thou art so good!<p>

Through many dangers, toils, and cares<br>
SPAM has seen me through: <br>
It's saved me from the bears in the woods, <br>
And it's a great companion, too.<p>

SPAM tastes like nothing else on earth,<br>
Pure manna from the gods!<br>
Though pink and gelid with texture strange,<br>
It's edible, against all odds.<p>

If I go on ten thousand hikes,<br>
I'll need a million cans<br>
'Cause SPAM is great for an extra pair of socks, <br>
Ground cover, and making rubber bands.<p>

<b>13 Ways of Looking at SPAM</b><br>

<b>The Dance of Love</b><p>

Like a siren you beckoned.<br>
My thoughts ran wild as I drew near to you.<br>
Your name alone lured a rage of hunger.<br>
I held you softly in my hand<br>
As I listened to the unspoken sound of<br>
Your enticement: "tink."<br>
Slowly I watched your walls of steel<br>
Crumble before my eyes.<br>
"Eureka!" I shouted in silence.<br>
My hands began to tremble<br>
As I fondled your somber blue apparel.<br>
My lips moistened as I salivated with anticipation.<br>
Could this truly be happening?<br>
At this very moment in time?<br>
Savoring the thought<br>
I drew you near to my soul.<br>
My lips embraced your tenderness.<br>
Warm sensations throbbed through my veins.<br>
Your taste was bittersweet,<br>
As I plunged you deep in the<br>
Chasm of my pleasure.<br>
The warmth of your sultry pink flesh<br>
Engulfed my existence<br>
Like a clean wind of a cool mountain top.<p>

Ah . . . #%$^&%$^*$%^*&^#<p>

"Hey Sammy! . . ." A voice cried out from the dark smoke filled room.<br>
"You damn pervert!!!  Put the SPAM down and come deal the cards."<p>

As in life, we sometimes must have a rude awakening.<br>

<b>I'm in the Mood for SPAM</b><br>
<em>(With apologies to Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh)</em><p>

I'm in the mood for SPAM, simply because it's near me.<br>
Funny, but when it's near me, I'm in the mood for SPAM.<br>
Breakfast is overdue, the kitchen's all asunder.<br>
Oh, is it any wonder?<br>
I'm in the mood for SPAM.<br>
Why stop and think of whither this little meat was made?<br>
Please bring the blue can hither: I'm omnivore, I'm not afraid.<br>
If there's but little ham, if there's no bacon handy,<br>
I find the gel just dandy--<br>
I'm in the mood for SPAM.<br>

Found myself stuck on a bungee stick<br>
In a jungle full of rot.<br>
Only one thing worse in life,<br>
SPAM for me, not!<br>

<b>Passing up old SPAM on a Snowy Evening</b><br>
<em>(with apologies to Robert Frost)</em><p>

Whose woods these are I do not know<br>
But there's a can here in the snow,<br>
A bit of blue and tan appear<br>
With an expiration date: One Nine Eight Oh.<p>

My hiking companions must think it queer<br>
That I'd stop with our destination so near,<br>
They don't care what's in a can<br>
Unless it is a micro beer.<p>

I ponder for a moment; "Nay,<br>
I'll not open up this can today."<br>
Though I know there is no need to fear<br>
It's only in its twentieth year.<p>

The can is lovely--tan and blue<br>
But I promised my doctor that what I'd do<br>
Is get no closer to it than SPAM-ku<br>
Is get no closer to it then SPAM-ku.<br>

<b>Ode to SPAM</b><p>

Eat it for lunch<br>
Or maybe for tea<br>
SPAM is real good<br>
For you and for me<p>

Just open that can<br>
And plop! on the plate<br>
That pink slimy sausage<br>
It looks oh so great<p>

Covered in jelly<br>
A rectangle quite hard<br>
And it smells so fine<br>
That odor of lard!<p>

What is it you ask<br>
I really can’t say<br>
You want to know what<br>
It was yesterday<p>

Perhaps it was dog<br>
Or maybe 'twas cat<br>
Or scurrying around<br>
The meat of a rat!<p>

But no my dear reader<br>
There’s only one source<br>
That meat that you crave<br>
It comes from a horse!<p>

Well really you cry<br>
I really don’t dig!<br>
Cause I have been told<br>
It’s flesh from a pig<p>

Yes you are right<br>
It’s chopped up dead hog<br>
Not chicken or rat<br>
Or possum or dog<p>

A magnificent creature<br>
Put in a can<br>
The pig that was killed<br>
To make up your SPAM!<br>

There it was just a sittin' on the shelf<br>
My palms were sweaty and I couldn't help myself<br>
I looked around and I opened up my belt<br>
I closed my eyes just thinkin' about the slime<br>
And all the nasty stuff I'd do if it were mine<br>
I was hard as a rock standing in the checkout line<br>
I left the store but I didn't get too far<br>
I folded down the back seats in my grandmother's car<br>
Then I rammed the SPAM till I shot my jam<br>
And coated the sides of my Teflon pan<br>
I belted out the lyrics to "I am the Man"<br>
Then ate my salty plate of protein filled SPAM<br>

Two very nice things about SPAM, at the least--<br>
(so contrived a product of so honest a beast):<br>
* so many nice piggies who might else not have met,<br>
* so many piggy parts you might else not have et.<br>

SPAM.<br>
Quivering, pink glop.<br>
Oh, thou fair artery-clogging<br>
Enemy of dieticians.<br>
Thou<br>
Stuff<br>
Posing<br>
As<br>
Meat.<br>
You intrigue me.<br>
Your golden gel<br>
Surrounding succulent<br>
Fatty acids<br>
Glucose<br>
And<br>
Pork bits.<br>
Worse than the hot dogs in content<br>
You care not.<br>
The turkey may say SPAM,<br>
But I say no more.<br>
Vegetarian's worst nightmare.<br>
ALL the naughty bits<br>
Compressed into an innocuous-looking cube.<br>
Hormel's gift to mankind.<br>
