              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"SPAM, SPAM, 
                SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, lovely SPAM, wonderful SPAM 
                etc&quot; </font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's hardly 
                poetry, is it? But it did help to make the Hormel Foods Corporation's 
                luncheon meat reasonably famous during the golden days of Monty 
                Python's Flying Circus. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Pythons 
                have become old and respectable, but the SPAM goes ever on, thanks 
                to a site on the World Wide Web which is at once a tribute to 
                what Chambers Dictionary defines as "tinned processed meat made 
                mainly from pork" and a celebration of haiku, a three-line, 17-syllable 
                poetry form. </font>

                site</a> looks like a labour of love for John Nagamichi Cho, who 
                opened his haiku SPAM archive under four years ago and has since 
                received more than 12,000 haiku on the subject. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He's even 
                collected them into a book: SPAM-ku - Tranquil Reflections on 
                a Luncheon Loaf. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On his archive's 
                homepage, John writes: "This WWW site was created so that anyone 
                who comes under the influence of this enigmatic porcine muse can 
                share his/her poetic epiphany with the rest of the world. Even 
                if you are not inspired to contribute to the archive, you can 
                browse through and marvel at the works of genius that SPAM has 
                motivated in others." </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SPAM haiku 
                collection is as close as you'll get to literature on the web, 
                although its success has surprised even its webmaster, as he told 
                me by email. </font>

                John: "Four years ago there was a small collection of SPAM haiku' 
                (technically senryu) of unknown origin being passed around on 
                the Internet. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"When I received 
                them I thought they were the funniest things I'd come across in 
                quite a while. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I immediately 
                wrote a bunch myself and passed them on to a friend, who also 
                did the same then suggested I start a Web site to collect others' 
                work. After that it was like in that movie, Field of Dreams: I 
                built the archive, and the SPAM-ku arrived. In droves. </font>
              <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Since the 
                archive opened in June 1995, I've been receiving 10 entries per 
                day on the average. We have well over 12,000 now. It's been written 
                up in most major U.S. newspapers, the Independent in the U.K., 
                Le Monde in France, etc." </font>
