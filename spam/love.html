<h1>SPAM Haiku: Love</h1>

SHAM-89.<br>
I kissed you at lunch,<br>
Your lips still shiny from the<br>
Hot, freshly fried slice.<p>

SHAM-90.<br>
I sent her ninety<br>
SPAM haiku to show my love.<br>
She sent me a shrink.<p>

SHAM-101.<br>
Supermarket aisle.<br>
We reached for the same SPAM can.<br>
We exchanged numbers.<p>

SHAM-102.<br>
You carved my figure<br>
From the block of SPAM.  Love or<br>
Infatuation?<p>

SHAM-103.<br>
The first time we kissed:<br>
Your cheeks flushed a deep SPAM pink,<br>
Your lips soft, hungry.<p>

SHAM-104.<br>
I buried the ring<br>
Inside a loaf.  You took a<br>
Bite, spat, then said, "Yes!"<p>

SHAM-105.<br>
Wedding catered by<br>
Hormel.  Reception marred by<br>
Sudden illnesses.<p>

SHAM-106.<br>
Honeymoon in France.<br>
Finally got to try the<br>
<em>Spamme frites</em>, <em>Spamme l'orange</em>.<p>

SHAM-107.<br>
Four children later<br>
We run out of things to say.<br>
"Price of SPAM is up."<p>

SHAM-108.<br>
"Breakfast in bed, love."<br>
"What is it, dear?"  "Refried SPAM."<br>
You filed for divorce.<p>

SHAM-109.<br>
The first nights were bad.<br>
Woke up from a SPAM nightmare--<br>
But you were not there.<p>

SHAM-110.<br>
I live alone now.<br>
I keep a cat for comfort.<br>
She does not eat SPAM.<p>

SHAM-111.<br>
Supermarket aisle.<br>
I saw her reach for a SPAM.<br>
I turned, walked away.<p>

155.<br>

it can't find a porcine mate<br>
