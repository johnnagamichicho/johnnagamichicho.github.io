<h1>SPAM Haiku: The SHAM's Tasty Picks (Part 5)</h1>

<b>Note:</b> Please do not send mail bombs if your haiku is not
included in this collection.  It is, however, acceptable to send a
slice of SPAM in an envelope as a gesture of protest.  Remember, this
is just one person's opinion as to what is cool.  (And note that I do
not include my own work here, since it is collected in separate files:
<a href="mine.html">SPAM haiku by the SHAM (1-100)</a>, <a
href="mine1.html">SPAM haiku by the SHAM (101-200)</a>, and <a
href="mine2.html">SPAM haiku by the SHAM (201- )</a>.)<p>
