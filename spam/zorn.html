<h1>17-Syllable Art Places Meaty SPAM in Poetry's Web</h1>

<h2>Eric Zorn</h2>

Fortuitously<br>
friends sent Spam haiku this way<br>
Har! column fodder!<p>

Yes, I'm aware that the above is not, technically, haiku; that
haiku--the non-rhyming Japanese poetry most often written in the
three-line, five/seven/five syllabic pattern--traditionally addresses
seasons, imagery in nature and the like; and that the more accurate
term would be <em>senryu</em>, a poetic form with wider latitude.<p>

But "haiku" will do<br>
terminologically<br>
for now, poem snobs.<p>

Most of us learned to write it in elementary school. The simple art taught
us about syllables and economy of word and thought while it broadened our
conception of poetry beyond the cadenced rhymes of Mother Goose.<p>

Some never let go<br>
Haiku charms them, though they age<br>
Obsessed? You tell me.<p>

One such devotee is John Cho, 32, known to his colleagues at the
National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center observatory in Arecibo,
Puerto Rico, as a mild-mannered research associate in atmospheric
sciences, but known to the cyber world as the Spam Haiku Archive
Master.<p>

"I put my shoes on<br>
but remembered far too late<br>
My secret Spam stash."<br>
(Tom Elliott)<p>

Cho put up his Spam site on the World Wide Web <a href="sha.html">
(http://www.naic.edu/~jcho/spam/sha.html)</a> exactly nine months ago and
it now features close to 3,000 haiku contributed by those "under the
influence of this enigmatic porcine muse," as Cho puts it.<p>

"Does Spam contain tongues?<br>
When you eat it, does it taste<br>
you as you taste it?"<br>
(Chris Fishel)<p>

Spam, the famous ham-like comestible, is its own punch line here and
in a generous number of other Spam-related sites on the web (Church of
Spam, the Spam-Cam, John's Shrine to Spam and so on) to which one can
connect directly from the Spam Archive.<p>

"Oh, set it on fire<br>
run it over or stab it,<br>
Spam is immortal."<br>
(Dawn M. Martin)<p>

<a name="hormel">
"We know it's out there and we don't necessarily like it," said a
spokeswoman for Hormel Foods Corp., makers of Spam. She added, "I
don't understand what it's all about, this haiku business."<p>

"The simple pleasure<br>
of blooming geraniums<br>
lifts my eyes from work."<br>
(Andreas Schoter)<p>

Now that's a proper haiku, as found in one of a handful of serious
haiku sites on the web. At their best they are like little nuggets of
gold, "transmitters of the smallest manageable element of insight," as
one expert wrote.<p>

"In the late autumn<br>
when leaves wither and fall down,<br>
my nose crumbles off."<br>
(Elliott C. Evans)<p>

Now that's an improper haiku, as found in a site on the World Wide Web
dedicated to haiku about leprosy. Here's another:<p>

"We are holding hands,<br>
our fingers intertwine--hey,<br>
come back here with that."<br>
(Andy Plotkin)<p>

Cho's Spam Haiku archive links web surfers to the leprosy site and
many other places for specialty haiku, including one dedicated to the
late TV star Bill Bixby--<p>

"Oh Bill, Bill Bixby<br>
Bill, Bill Bixby, Bill Bixby<br>
What a wacky guy"<br>
(Mike McNally)<p>

--one featuring movie reviews in haiku, such as this about  "Leaving Las
Vegas:"--<p>

"Drunken and stumbling<br>
If you attend, bring hankies<br>
Punishing viewing."<br>
(unk.)<p>

--and one offering haiku about and for computer nerds--<p>

"My ROMS, code laden<br>
trace into the O/S now<br>
forbidden knowledge."<br>
(Jack Holt)<p>

One can also find haiku about science fiction, called SciFaiku:<p>

"Kirk argues with Spock<br>
Scotty, an alcoholic?<br>
Bones is just bitchy."<br>
(Jeff Hobbs)<p>

We have here evidence of a high-tech, haiku renaissance led by a
culturally prominent luncheon loaf. I thought you should know about it.<p>

Is this a column?<br>
An honest day's work for Zorn?<br>
Maybe not. Sue me.<p>
