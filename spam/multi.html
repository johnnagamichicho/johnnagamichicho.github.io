<h1>SPAM Haiku: Multi-verse</h1>

<h2>A Cathartic Trilogy</h2>

SHAM-21.<br>
A SPAM loaf quivers.<br>
Salivary glands juice up.<br>
Anticipation.<p>

SHAM-22.<br>
The gullet rises.<br>
Salivary glands juice up.<br>
&quot;You ate the whole loaf!?&quot;<p>

SHAM-23.<br>
Post-SPAM catharsis:<br>
Peptic acid and pink chunks.<br>
Floor-mount Pollock piece.<p>

<h2>The SPAM Cycle of Love</h2>

SHAM-101.<br>
Supermarket aisle.<br>
We reached for the same SPAM can.<br>
We exchanged numbers.<p>

SHAM-102.<br>
You carved my figure<br>
From the block of SPAM.  Love or<br>
Infatuation?<p>

SHAM-103.<br>
The first time we kissed:<br>
Your cheeks flushed a deep SPAM pink,<br>
Your lips soft, hungry.<p>

SHAM-104.<br>
I buried the ring<br>
Inside a loaf.  You took a<br>
Bite, spat, then said, "Yes!"<p>

SHAM-105.<br>
Wedding catered by<br>
Hormel.  Reception marred by<br>
Sudden illnesses.<p>

SHAM-106.<br>
Honeymoon in France.<br>
Finally got to try the<br>
<em>Spamme frites</em>, <em>Spamme l'orange</em>.<p>

SHAM-107.<br>
Four children later<br>
We run out of things to say.<br>
"Price of SPAM is up."<p>

SHAM-108.<br>
"Breakfast in bed, love."<br>
"What is it, dear?"  "Refried SPAM."<br>
You filed for divorce.<p>

SHAM-109.<br>
The first nights were bad.<br>
Woke up from a SPAM nightmare--<br>
But you were not there.<p>

SHAM-110.<br>
I live alone now.<br>
I keep a cat for comfort.<br>
She does not eat SPAM.<p>

SHAM-111.<br>
Supermarket aisle.<br>
I saw her reach for a SPAM.<br>
I turned, walked away.<p>

<h2>The Physics of SPAM Waves</h2>

SHAM-131.<br>
New discovery:<br>
SPAM waves.  Thought to propagate<br>
In gel-like ether.<p>

SHAM-132.<br>
SPAM-wave detector:<br>
Immerse man in gel.  If he<br>
Gains weight, SPAM wave's there.<p>

SHAM-133.<br>
Can information<br>
Be sent by using SPAM waves?<br>
No.  Just calories.<p>

SHAM-134.<br>
SPAM wave as weapon<br>
Used during Cold War.  Doubtful?<br>
Yeltsin's size.  Case closed.<p>

SHAM-135.<br>
Remote sensing with<br>
SPAM waves needs work.  Too much pork<br>
In the ground clutter.<p>

SHAM-136.<br>
Communist China<br>
Uses SPAM waves for jamming.<br>
All you get's pink noise.<p>

SHAM-137.<br>
Relativity<br>
Predicts SPAM waves will bend near<br>
Massive trailer parks.<p>

SHAM-138.<br>
Astronomy news:<br>
SPAM waves from distant stars are<br>
Always pink-shifted.<p>

SHAM-139.<br>
As an object gets<br>
Near the speed of SPAM waves, its<br>
Fat content goes up.<p>

<h2>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a SPAM (with
apologies to Wallace Stevens)</h2>

SHAM-141.<br>
Twenty loaded shelves.<br>
The only moving thing was<br>
The eye of the SPAM.<p>

SHAM-142.<br>
I was of three minds,<br>
Like a SPAM in which there are<br>
Three major organs.<p>

SHAM-143.<br>
A SPAM swirled in the<br>
Frying pan.  'Twas a small part<br>
Of the pantomime.<p>

SHAM-144.<br>
A boy and a girl<br>
Are one.  A boy and a girl<br>
And a SPAM are one.<p>

SHAM-145.<br>
Which do I prefer?<br>
The beauty of ingestion<br>
Or what comes after?<p>

SHAM-146.<br>
Kitchen windowsill.<br>
Lit by passing headlights, SPAM<br>
Casts a long shadow.<p>

SHAM-147.<br>
Thin men of Haddam,<br>
Don't you see the SPAM rising<br>
In your women's pans?<p>

SHAM-148.<br>
I know what's good food;<br>
But I also know that the<br>
SPAM knows that I know.<p>

SHAM-149.<br>
When the SPAM was fried,<br>
Its grease marked the edge of one<br>
Of many circles.<p>

SHAM-150.<br>
At the smell of SPAM,<br>
Even bawds of euphony<br>
Would cry out sharply.<p>

SHAM-151.<br>
Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
In that he mistook his wife<br>
For a loaf of SPAM.<p>

SHAM-152.<br>
Smoke issues from the<br>
Kitchen.  Dogs retch in gutters.<br>
SPAM must be cooking.<p>

SHAM-153.<br>
The aisles were empty.<br>
They would always be empty.<br>
SPAM sat on the shelf.<p>

<h2>A SPAM Adventure</h2>

1291.<br>
I saw the blue can<br>
In the tinned products section<br>
It captured my thoughts<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1292.<br>
Thoughts entered my dreams<br>
The blue can--contents unknown<br>
Cryptic label--SPAM<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1293.<br>
Three days passed slowly<br>
Obsession overcame me<br>
I must purchase SPAM<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1294.<br>
I lurked in the aisles<br>
No one was looking at me<br>
I reached for a tin<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1295.<br>
Cradling my new prize<br>
I went to pay--disaster!<br>
"Price check on large SPAM."<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1296.<br>
But nobody stared<br>
I noticed them holding tins<br>
Brotherhood of SPAM<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1297.<br>
Soon I arrived home,<br>
Dimmed the lights, shut the curtains,<br>
And prepared to feast.<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1298.<br>
I removed the key<br>
Peeled back the metal layer<br>
The fragrance hit me<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1299.<br>
I woke on the floor<br>
Six hours of my life were gone<br>
And so was the SPAM...<br>
<address>--Tom Elliott, Tosh@Werple.mira.net.au</address><p>

1300.<br>
And sometimes at night<br>
I lay awake, listening,<br>
And I can hear it.<br>
