    <b><em>SPAM-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf</em><i><br>
    </i></b>by John Nagamichi Cho<br>
    HarperPerennial<br>
    $7.95</p>
    <p>By Jessica Lyons</p>
    <p><em>Ate three cans of SPAM, <br>
    But there&#146;s still room for Jell-O.</em></p>
    <p>I <i>love </i>this country.</p>
    <p>And we love John Cho&#146;s collection of Spam-ku (Spam-related haiku). Cho, a
    researcher at MIT and the Spam Haiku Archive Master, or S.H.A.M., has been selflessly
    preserving Spam-ku for future generations since 1995. Three years later, his compilation
    numbers 162. And we didn&#146;t even know that many people actually eat cubed pig in a
    tin. We recommend this fleshy compilation to anyone who likes these pink loaves, sings
    about Spam with Monty Python or simply relishes the taste of some finger-lickin&#146; good
    poetry. Vegetarians beware.</p>
