<h1>Submitting a SPAM Ku to the Archive</h1>

Writing a SPAM ku is easy.  Just concentrate all your energy on the
essence of SPAMness, then write down whatever comes to mind.  But make
sure that the words come out in 3 lines with 5 then 7 then 5
syllables.<p>

Here's an example from the archive:<p>

<b>Sunset placid pond<br>
Where campers often linger--<br>
Rusted can of SPAM.</b><br><p>

Count the syllables in each line.  5-7-5.  See?  It's simple.<p>

<h2> Submit your SPAM ku here, through the magic of the AUTOku web form! </h2>
<P>

If you want italics or bold, use the appropriate HTML tags.  You can
submit as many as you want, but I reserve the right as the SPAM Haiku
Archive Master (SHAM) to edit for spelling, punctuation, and syllable
count, or to reject any entry.<p>

<b>Note:</b> The definition of orthodox haiku is a little bit more
complicated.  For example, check out <a
href="http://home1.pacific.net.sg/~loudon/alexey_def.htm">one aficionado's haiku
definition</a>.  Also, technically, SPAM <a
href="http://www.umich.edu/~troq/Gardens/senryu.html"><em>senryu</em></a>
is closer to what we are doing than SPAM haiku.<p>
