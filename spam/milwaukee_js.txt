BODY:
The title alone may make you giggle: "Spam-Ku: Tranquil Reflections on
Luncheon Loaf" (Harper Perennial, 1998, $7.95).

Just as the world is getting a little crazier with the approach of a new
millennium, one constant remains: Spam.

This collection of heartfelt, hilarious (and some might say hideous) odes
does have a distinctive flavor. It was co mpiled by John Nagamichi Cho, a
self-proclaimed Spam Haiku Archive Master. This guy does hold a real job as
a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A few examples of the
writing inspired by Spam:

"Perfection uncanned / Like a beautiful redhead/ Fresh from her trailer";
"Wore my Spam boxers. Struck down by a speeding bus. Paramedics laughed.";
and "Locked in room with Spam. Try to pick lock with can's key. It snaps,
I'm doomed."

A personal favorite: "I sent he r eighty Spam haiku to show my love. She
sent me to a shrink."
