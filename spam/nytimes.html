<img src="/images/f.gif" align=left alt=F>or the moment, anyway, John
Nagamichi Cho's new book has
a category unto itself at the
Library of Congress. His Internet-derived collection of haiku-like verse
inspired by Spam, the popular processed-pork product, is the sole listing under the subject heading
"Canned meat -- poetry."

<p> With the deaths last year of the
Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs, Cho crowed,
"I'm the first in a generation of
'meat poets.' "

<p> For "Spam-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf" (88 pp.,
HarperCollins, $7.95), Cho sliced
162 prime examples of porcine poetry out of the <a href=#1>Spam Haiku Archive</a>, a
Web site he launched as a lark in
June 1995. To date, about 1,500 online
poets have submitted more than
11,000 entries to the site. All refer in
some manner to the rosy-toned Hormel Foods product, and most follow
the three-line, 5-7-5 pattern of syllables that schoolchildren learn is the
classic haiku form. The Spam-ku
range from earnest, often ham-fisted
efforts at evoking a mood, such as
Cho's "The first time we
kissed:/ Your cheeks flushed a deep
Spam pink,/ Your lips soft, hungry"
to such swinishly punny entries as
Chris Fishel's "Descartes on pig
parts/ Says: I'm pink, therefore I'm
Spam/ Deep philosophy."

<p> Cho, a 34-year-old research
scientist at M.I.T., attributes part of
Spam-ku's popularity to the simple
fact that it is a short, silly-sounding
word. "It's hard to compose haiku
about Vienna sausage or Canadian
bacon," Cho said. "They take up
too many syllables.

<p>He said that contributors liked to play with the tension between the nostalgia invoked
by Spam's rich history -- introduced
in 1937, it was a staple of many
wartime diets -- and its anachronistic status today as processed pork in
a fresh-meat era.

<p> More than anything, though,
Spam-ku are easy to compose, an
appealing ingredient for those taking
advantage of the Web's self-publishing capabilities. Cho's site also
contains an area for haiku about
news events, and earlier this year
 <a href=#1>Salon</a>, the online magazine, held a
competition for haiku error messages.

<p> "American poetry in the 20th Century has become pretty intimidating," Cho said. "Both rhyme and
meter have gone out of fashion, and
people find it hard to understand
what poetry is and how to write it.
Here, you have a very simple structure that anyone can follow -- although you'd be surprised how many
entries I get that miss the syllable
count."

<p> Francis Heaney has written about
230 Spam-ku for the archive.
"They're not all gems," Heaney
conceded. His favorite -- "Moon
rises,/ White as two slices of bread,/
Sunset pink as Spam within" -- did
not make it into Cho's book.

<p> Although he has since abandoned
the form, Heaney, a 28-year-old
puzzle writer and editor in Manhattan, said, "I do my best writing under
constraints, so the constraint of a
haiku, plus the fact that it has to be
about Spam, is very limiting. To do
things within that is fun."

<p>Because haiku almost always involves nature, Heaney sought to
incorporate that element into his poems.

<p>Would that requirement be fulfilled by a reference to Spam alone?
"It's made out of pigs," Heaney
replied. "I guess pigs are natural."

<p> Another entry that did not make it
into the book was this candidate
from Alex Dunne: "Spam's own irony/ Is that its haiku's never/ Worse
than Spam itself."

<p> Haiku experts are skeptical about
the new form. "It's technically not
poetry," said Lee Gurga, a dentist
from Lincoln, Ill., who recently
served as president of the <a href=#1>Haiku
Society of America</a>. "Spam haiku makes
statements; statements are not the
same as images."

<p> Despite Cho's claims to the
contrary, Dr. Gurga said, the archive
entries are not "senryu" either.
"Senryu have to do with human nature, and they can be very funny, but
they tend to have a little more resonance than Spam." Ultimately, Dr.
Gurga said, Spam-ku "doesn't bother
me in the least," adding, "I like it
when people have fun."

<p> And Dr. Gurga said he hoped that
the archive would lead visitors to
more serious haiku sites on the Internet. Well-regarded examples include
Dhugal J. Lindsay's <a href=#1>Haiku Universe</a> and the <a href=#1>Shiki Internet Haiku Salon</a>.

<p> Cho's slim volume represents
a burgeoning breed of books that
were sired in cyberspace. Jeremie
Ruby-Strauss, who edited "Spam-ku" for HarperCollins and has published a compendium of martini recipes siphoned from a Web site, approached Cho after stumbling
upon his archive.

<p> Ruby-Strauss, who uses an unopened can of Spam as a paperweight, said he had seen Spam-ku
swapped with gusto elsewhere on the
Net.

<p>"Here's a product that's been
marketed," Ruby-Strauss said of
Spam, but there was no literary
product. "So let's make a product."

<p>At his publisher's insistence,
Cho sent his selections to Hormel at
its headquarters in Austin, Minn., for
approval. He omitted those he feared
might raise objections.

<p> For the most part, Cho said,
"They just wanted all the capitalizations right and for some strange reason, they said no possessives."

<p> The book's illustrations received
the toughest inspection. One that
showed a mouse sniffing at a tin of
Spam was rejected by the company.

<p> "They said, 'Please, no rodents
associated with Spam,' " Cho
recalled. "We just decided to can
that one."

<p> Hormel officials declined to comment, but the company does maintain a tongue-in-cheek Web site for
its product (<a href=#1>www.spam.com</a>).

<p> In addition to offering a Spam
mouse pad for sale, the site contains
a dissertation that strives to distance
the company from "spam," Internet
slang for unsolicited e-mail. The
term was derived from a Monty Python comedy routine in which the
word is repeated ad nauseum.

<p> A few weeks ago, at the bidding of
a friend's daughter who enjoyed the
book and wanted to sample its salty,
spicy subject, Cho consumed
Spam for the first time in nearly 20
years. Despite his seven-syllable description of the sensation -- an "elastic, rubbery feel" -- he said the experience had not prompted him to compose a haiku about the moment. After penning 200 entries for the online
archive, Cho lost his appetite for
the verse form in early 1996.

<p> "It was like an addiction," he recalled. "When it was over, it was
completely over. I went cold turkey."
