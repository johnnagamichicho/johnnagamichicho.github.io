<h2>The Epic SPAM Haiku Cycle of Love</h2>

Supermarket aisle.<br>
We reached for the same SPAM can.<br>
We exchanged numbers.<p>

You carved my figure<br>
From the block of SPAM.  Love or<br>
Infatuation?<p>

The first time we kissed:<br>
Your cheeks flushed a deep SPAM pink,<br>
Your lips soft, hungry.<p>

I buried the ring<br>
Inside a loaf.  You took a<br>
Bite, spat, then said, "Yes!"<p>

Wedding catered by<br>
Hormel.  Reception marred by<br>
Sudden illnesses.<p>

Honeymoon in France.<br>
Finally got to try the<br>
<em>Spamme frites</em>, <em>Spamme l'orange</em>.<p>

Four children later<br>
We run out of things to say.<br>
"Price of SPAM is up."<p>

"Breakfast in bed, love."<br>
"What is it, dear?"  "Refried SPAM."<br>
You filed for divorce.<p>

The first nights were bad.<br>
Woke up from a SPAM nightmare--<br>
But you were not there.<p>

I live alone now.<br>
I keep a cat for comfort.<br>
She does not eat SPAM.<p>

Supermarket aisle.<br>
I saw her reach for a SPAM.<br>
I turned, walked away.<p>

<h2>PSAlM 23 (by Martin H. Booda)</h2>

The Lord is my swine-<br>
herd; I shall not want.  He forms<br>
me to fit in tins.<p>

He makes a green fringe<br>
About my rind.  He packs me<br>
In the spring waters.<p>

He synthesizes<br>
My flavor; He scrapes me from<br>
The slaughterhouse floor.<p>

Yea, though I trot towards<br>
The abattoir, I will fear<br>
no disembowelment.<p>

For Thou standest o'er<br>
Me; Thy cudgel and Thy knife<br>
They do dispatch me.<p>

Thou preparest a<br>
Dish of me in the presence<br>
Of my predators.<p>
 
Thou anointest my<br>
Slices with mayonnaise; my<br>
Grease runneth over.<p>
 
Surely parsley and<br>
Cloves will garnish me all the<br>
Days of my shelflife.<p>

And I will dwell in<br>
Plaque-encrusted arteries<br>
Forever.  Amen.<p>

<h2>The Serious Side of SPAM Haiku</h2>

A half-eaten slice.<br>
Ants swarm the cold, greasy plate.<br>
A suicide note.<p>

A prostitute leans<br>
From a rust-stained balcony<br>
Spooning from a can.<p>

Next-door barbecue.<br>
Smell of T-bones waft over.<br>
Eat SPAM with closed eyes.<p>

Night kitchen cupboard.<br>
Roach scuttles around SPAM can.<br>
Cutting steak in dream.<p>

Winter trailer home:<br>
Bills unpaid--no heat inside.<br>
Raw SPAM for dinner.<p>

How to feed twelve mouths:<br>
SPAM and Hamburger Helper<br>
Spread thin on white bread.<p>

Housing project dump:<br>
Rats rattling the empty cans,<br>
Stench of rotting pigs.<p>

Through the looking glass<br>
SPAM maps, isomorph, puzzled.<br>
It glows a strange blue.<p>
