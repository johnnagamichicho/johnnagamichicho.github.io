<B>"SPAM-ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf." Edited by John Nagamichi Cho. HarperPerennial. New York. $7.95. 88 pages.</B><P>
   Forget about settling in front of the fireplace this winter with some kind of Life is Too Much anthology of poems, sighing at the beaded drizzle on the windows.  This is the poetry book you'll want in hand as storm clouds gather over the Bay.<P>
   "SPAM-ku," brainchild of Stanford grad and MIT researcher John Nagamichi Cho, offers 162 odes to Hormel's canned pigmeat by more than 40 writers, starting with John Mitchell's selection in "Americana":<P>
    Perfection uncanned<P>
   Like a beautiful redhead<P>
   Fresh from her trailer<P>
   Mitchell, a marketing writer from Belmont, was drawn to SPAM haiku through a tongue-in-pig-cheek Web site Cho set up from MIT. Thousands of poems spilled across the software wires in the first year and the total now stands at more than 10,000.<P>
   "I can't take credit for coming up with the idea," explained Cho. "I kind of threw it out on the Web and 'SPAM-ku' arrived. It took off amazingly, I got hooked on it, and the rest is history."<P>
  Cho is "the grandmaster of the form," said Mitchell, a vegetarian who has written more than 200 SPAM poems. "I consider haiku the most refined form of poetry, and there was something simultaneously lofty and ridiculous about 'SPAM-ku' that just set me off," Mitchell said. "It was an obsession."<P>
   Mitchell pointed to No. 114 in "SPAM-ku," one of his more obscure works:<P>
    The beach picnic ends.<P>
   The sand blows, the naked SPAM<P>
   Puts on a tweed coat.<P>
   "There was this chunk of SPAM sitting on the table, sand stuck to it," he said. "These thoughts... the coat... just came to me at random."<P>
   Hormel had the right to review poem selections, said Cho, so some of the more controversial ones were lost in the final run-through, including:<P>
    Using only SPAM<P>
   Grandma made some tasty treats<P>
   We set her on fire.<P>
   But other Cho favorites made the cut, including No. 100:<P>
    Black cat drags about<P>
   His pink, purloined bite of SPAM<P>
   like an extra tongue.<P>
   Book chapters include "Anticipation and Desire," "Sex and Romance," "Physics and Mathematics" and "Nature," and each section is a marvel, a shimmering look at the gobbling ooze. Those who quail at the knowledge that two thin slices of SPAM contain a third of your daily quota for saturated fats and sodium and more than 10 percent of your cholestorol needs can still turn to Cho's Web site (<A HREF="./" target="top">http://pemtropics.mit.edu/jcho/spam/</A>) for haiku contemplation.<P>
  Cho is quick to point out that many of the 5-7-5 poems in "SPAM-ku" are "senryu rather than haiku," dealing more with metre than the traditional imagery of nature. But the spirit remains the same, he said &#151; the book still sings of the history, taste and romantic tremble of SPAM.<P>
   Here's a sampling:<P>
   2.<P>
    Ate three cans of SPAM,<P>

   Kerouac long gone.<P>
<P>
   143.<P>
    Waxed my car with SPAM.<P>
   The finish gleams, water beads,<P>
   Hungry dogs chase it.<P>
<P>
   146.<P>
    An empty SPAM can.<P>
   My boy makes a sea-blue boat.<P>
   Its hold smells of pork.<p>
