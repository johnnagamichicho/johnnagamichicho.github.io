<h1>Excerpt from "From Pork Bellies to SPAM"</h1>

<h2>Tim Ouellette</h2>

For sheer fun, though, I visit the Spam Haiku Archive (<a
href="./">http://www.naic.edu/~jcho/spam</a>).  Brought
to my attention by a fellow worker, this site shines through as an
example of the complete quirkiness accessible on the Web.  Mixing the
ancient Japanese poetry form of Haiku with the modern day creation
(some say abomination) of Spam has spawned thousands of strange and
unbelievable poems.<p>
