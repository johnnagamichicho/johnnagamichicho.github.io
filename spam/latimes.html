<h2>NEWSBITES</h2>

John Nagamichi Cho is a researcher at MIT, but even if he discovers a
cure for cancer, for some he'll still be best known as the master of one
of the Internet's legendary Web sites: the SPAM haiku archives. Now, for
the browser-impaired, he's collected the best in old-fashioned book form:
"<b>SPAM</b>-<b>ku</b>: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf" (HarperPerennial,
$7.95). Although he points out that many of the verses are not strictly
haiku (technically, he says, they are senryu), they are delicious
nonetheless.
<p>     "Perfection uncanned
<br>     Like a beautiful redhead
<br>     Fresh from her trailer."
<p>     Or
<p>     "Four children later
<br>     We run out of things to say.
<br>     'Price of SPAM is up.' "
