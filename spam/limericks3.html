SPAM is made by Hormel,<br>

but it's never too hard to sell!<br>
<address>--JW, GWren@Erols.com</address><p>

223.<br>

My colon just went "KA-BLAM!!"<br>
<address>--Wild T.</address><p>

225.<br>

A sad lonely tale I tell<br>
We ate it in bits,<br>
It gave us the shits,<br>
And made us feel not at all well.<br>
<address>--Wild T.</address><p>

226.<br>
The writings of SPAM on this page <br> 
Has sent me in some porcine rage<br>
The folks at Hormel<br>
Condemn me to hell<br>
For using some basil or sage<br>
<address>--Wild T.</address><p>

227.<br>
While Monkey Spanking Boy goes to classes,<br>
His courses he easily passes,<br>
The SPAM is so kind<br>
One day he'll go blind<br>
Or maybe he'll only need glasses<br>
<address>--MSB</address><p>

228.<br>

With SPAM all over his wanker<br>
Masturbating with swine<br>
Made him feel so sublime<br>
He has become quite the yanker<br>
<address>--MSB</address><p>

229.<br>
The Boy and the Monkey he Spanks<br>
To him "Master" is the highest of ranks<br>
With SPAM as his lover<br>
His neighbors take cover<br>
To Hormel he gives eternal thanks<br>
<address>--MSB</address><p>

230.<br>
Again there is Monkey Spanking Boy<br>
Using SPAM as his sexual toy<br>
"It works really well,<br>
Once you get past the smell.<br>
It's a sport that you'll really enjoy."<br>
<address>--MSB</address><p>

231.<br>
See the Boy Spanking his Monkey<br>
Using SPAM jelly because it's so chunky<br>
He gives us a lesson<br>
In by-product obsession<br>
And explains why his room smells oh so funky!<br>
<address>--MSB</address><p>

232.<br>

An over-inquisitive toucan<br>

235.<br>

Mixed with centipedes' knees<br>
To achieve an attractive aroma.<br>
<address>--Mike O'Connor (K.M.O'Connor), mickman@intonet.co.uk</address><p>

236.<br>
There once was a man from Japan<br>
Whose SPAMericks never would scan.<br>
When asked why this was,<br>
He said, "It's because<br>
I always try to get as many references to SPAM, SPAM Lite and other related<br>
Hormel products into the last line as I possibly can."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

237.<br>
A literary magpie named John<br>
Collected SPAM verse by the ton.<br>
He faced litigation<br>
At Hormel's instigation;<br>
I'd be quite upset if they won!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

238.<br>
The car dealers living on Guam<br>
Came up with a <em>really</em> dumb scam:<br>
For each car they sell<br>
They throw in as well--<br>
Believe me--a full case of SPAM!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

239.<br>
The tied and bound can didn't balk<br>
As the bloodthirsty Nazi named Vork,<br>
With a lamp glaring bright,<br>
Told the 12 ounce SPAM Lite,<br>
"Ve haf vays of making you pork!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

240.<br>
Said the torturous Nazi, "Reveal<br>
Vot I esk or be stretched on zis veel!"<br>
But the SPAM Lite was tough<br>
And it called the Kraut's bluff:<br>
"Though I'm made from pig parts, I won't squeal!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

241.<br>
Said Hyphenated Kid, "It's a sham-<br>
Bolic way to write verses like SPAM-<br>
Ericks.  They should flow<br>
Not too fast, not too slow-<br>
Ly but, frankly, I don't give a damn!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

242.<br>
I used to be sober and staid<br>
Before the first SPAMerick I made.<br>
It took over my life,<br>
Now I've lost my wife<br>
And my house, since the rent wasn't paid.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

243.<br>
Said the rose tint obsessive, "Just think<br>
How much of the wide world is pink;<br>
From elephants to panthers<br>
Via gin and Dianthus.<br>
And there's SPAM too!  I'm calling my shrink!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

244.<br>
Hormel's neighbor was put to the test<br>
By a noisy nocturnal SPAMfest.<br>
The response to his call:<br>
"We're holding a Pig's Ball."<br>
<i>"Well, let it go then we'll all get some rest!"</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

245.<br>
There once was a muppet named Spa'am<br>
(No relation to Hormel's spiced ha'am).<br>
Miss Piggy was hot<br>
So he said, "Why not?":<br>
A case of <i>wha'am ba'am, tha'ank you, ma'am!</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

246.<br>
A poor pig called out for her mamma<br>
When she heard she was destined for Parma.<br>
<i>To end her life--BAM!--<br>
As a pink Parma ham!</i><br>
Then she ran off to Austin: bad karma!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

247.<br>
The pig with unenviable karma<br>
Stowed away in the truck of a farmer<br>
As he drove one dark  night<br>
From the home of SPAM Lite.<br>
Now she s safe in the home of Jeff Dahmer!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

248.<br>
When the cops made their raid on Jeff Dahmer<br>
Our piggy was in her pyjamas.<br>
But she hid in a pile<br>
Of hair, guts and bile<br>
Then she made off, diguised as a llama!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

249.<br>
Our porky pal, dressed as a llama,<br>
Joined a circus bound for Yokohama.<br>
When they served up SPAM chunks<br>
She yelled out, "Freeze, punks!"<br>
(The thought of SPAM meat didn't charm her!)<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

250.<br>
As she threatened a trembling snake charmer,<br>
The cops made attempts to disarm her.<br>
They tried to suppress<br>
Her pigheadedness<br>
With appeals from the great Dalai Lama.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

251.<br>
The stun guns were brought out to calm her;<br>
Life flashed in a brief panorama.<br>
Hormel took her, poor sow!<br>
She was slaughtered and now<br>
She's the star of this year's SPAMarama!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

252.<br>
The movie, shot in the Bahamas,<br>
To be screened in deluxe Cinerama,<br>
Is financed by Hormel<br>
(Or so I hear tell)<br>
And directed by Brian De Palma.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

253.<br>
The moral: 'gainst death there's no armor,<br>
Though you be a rogue or a charmer.<br>
<i>"He who flees from his fate<br>
Runs right into it, mate!"</i><br>
(To misquote the Oedipus drama.)<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

254.<br>
Henpecked Dan couldn't forgive her<br>
When his wife served up diced SPAM and liver<br>
With cabbage and leek<br>
For the <i>fifth</i> time that week!<br>
His lip shook with a tremulous quiver.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

255.<br>
His pale hands were racked by a shiver.<br>
He couldn't eat even a sliver!<br>
It had an aroma<br>
Like a rank carcinoma<br>
Or a thing that has long ceased to slither!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

256.<br>
Dan's partner, the brawny Olivia--<br>
A mud-wrestling champ from Bolivia--<br>
Raced after her spouse<br>
As he left the house<br>
Yelling, "Hey, take these SPAM fritters with ya!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

257.<br>
His olfactory started to wither<br>
From the stench of the SPAM she brought with her.<br>
To improve his life<br>
He'd get rid of his wife<br>
By drowning the bitch in the river!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

258.<br>
"No!  She never goes down to the river...<br>
...But an O.D. of pills will deliver<br>
The thing I pursue,<br>
Crushed up in SPAM stew...<br>
...Damn!  She's taken the SPAM key out with her!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

259.<br>
"At this rate I'll never outlive her!<br>
One chance left! There's no time to dither.<br>
I'll phone Domino<br>
For SPAM pizza to go<br>
And dope up the half that I'll give her!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

260.<br>
Later Dan said, "I'd just like to give ya<br>
The crap you gave me, dear Olivia!"<br>
Now she's trapped by a ton<br>
Of SPAM cans in the john<br>
While he reads out a pile of SPAM trivia!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

261.<br>
Our Danny was always a giver;<br>
Whatever she asked he'd deliver.<br>
But now the worm's turned<br>
And his bridges he's burned.<br>
<i>(Not too wise if you live near a river!)</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

262.<br>
SPAM s miracle meat and thick gel<br>
Have health-giving properties as well:<br>
A full can each day<br>
Keeps the doctor away--<br>
Unless he has no sense of smell!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

263.<br>
A SPAMerick dilemma: how well<br>
I'm aware of this problem!  Please tell--<br>
Should people say "Hormel"<br>
So it rhymes with "normal"<br>
Or stress it to sound like "foretell"?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

264.<br>
SHAM told me, "The check's in the mail,<br>
Compensation for all your travail."<br>
So, increase your delight<br>
And stay tuned to this site<br>
For another SPAM limerick tale!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

265.<br>
The park ranger hadn't a care;<br>
He loved his job out in the air.<br>
But then some dumb critters<br>
Ate up his SPAM fritters.<br>
Now it's <i>"Exit, pursued by a bear"</i>!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

266.<br>
Here's another conundrum for you:<br>
How is it my SPAMericks get through<br>
To the Archive web site<br>
Before SPAMku I write<br>
In spite of the SPAM Autoku?<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

267.<br>
As we in the U.K. know well,<br>
You guys in the U.S. can't spell<br>
Words like "colour" and "centre";<br>
And SPAM's dumb-ass inventor<br>
Must also have no sense of smell!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

268.<br>
Mark Antony let out a gasp<br>
As Cleo unpinned her robe's clasp.<br>
But the ambience was broken<br>
When she saw his love token:<br>
"SPAM gift set for <i>me</i>?  Kiss my asp!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

269.<br>
All the clothes that I owned were too tight<br>
And my body a hideous sight<br>
When I O.D.'d on SPAM.<br>
Now I <i>like</i> who I am.<br>
What a difference since I've seen the Lite!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

270.<br>
The ad agency briefly had planned a<br>
Deluge of SPAM propaganda.<br>
But pork meat's passe;<br>
What the world wants today<br>
Is SPANGAROO, SPOSTRICH, and SPANDA!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

271.<br>
A pair working for Uncle Sam<br>
Probed Hormel's use of sheep with their ham.<br>
<i>(Headline used by the press<br>
To report their success:<br>
"Sam and Pam Van Damme Slam Lamb/SPAM scam!")</i><br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

272.<br>
Said the coach, with inveterate candor,<br>
To his quarterback-kicker, "Don't stand there<br>
Like a great lump of SPAM!<br>
Take the ball on the lam<br>
Or you'll never outclass old George Blanda!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

273.<br>
You'll find I'm a little effete<br>
When faced with a plate of SPAM meat.<br>
Its texture and odor<br>
Are just like a loada<br>
The stuff that a dog might excrete!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

274.<br>
A master chef named Alexander<br>
Said, "I really prefer something blander.<br>
But to mask SPAM's foul taste<br>
I use jalape&ntilde;o paste<br>
And a large scoop of ground coriander."<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

275.<br>
The guy at the end of my street<br>
Found my hobby a little offbeat.<br>
As far as he was aware<br>
A <i>SPAMku</i> is where<br>
You line up to buy pork luncheon meat!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

276.<br>
There once was a fellow named Scooter<br>
Who ate SPAM till it stiffened his hooter,<br>
Thus attracting a lass,<br>
Till, repelled by the gas,<br>
She informed him that he didn't suit her.<br>
<address>--Anonymous</address><p>

277.<br>
There once was a king from Siam<br>
Who based the economy on SPAM.<br>
Inflation got bad<br>
So they ate all they had<br>
And spent the next day in the can.<br>
<address>--The Natales, knatale@cgisystems.com</address><p>

278.<br>
Some advice from a health care report:<br>
"If you want to get rid of a wart,<br>
Prepare a SPAM dressing<br>
And, without too much pressing,<br>
The virus will start to abort!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

279.<br>
My long-suffering wife (her name's Tricia)<br>
Thought her dowdy old clothes should be swisher.<br>
But I've broken this stasis:<br>
With SPAM smeared on my glasses<br>
She's more gorgeous than Claudia Schiffer!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

280.<br>
I'm off on my holiday today<br>
(That's <i>vacation</i> in the U. S. of A.)<br>
To the old Emerald Isle.<br>
This is all for a while.<br>
(Take SPAMericks to <i>Limerick</i>?  No way!)<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

281.<br>
There once was a SPAM on a plate<br>
That got tired of having to wait.<br>
So it crawled to the floor<br>
And it oozed out the door<br>
And everyone thought this was great!<br>
<address>--Kepie Hamsterlicker</address><p>

282.<br>
Igor winced as he held the retort<br>
While Frankenstein poured in a quart<br>
Of sieved toads and mice<br>
With a huge pink SPAM slice--<br>
And the <i>can</i> as a final resort.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

283.<br>
But Frankenstein had to abort<br>
His attempt to make life of a sort.<br>
It became all too plain<br>
That, with SPAM for a brain,<br>
His endeavors would all come to nought.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

284.<br>
Poor Igor was somewhat distraught<br>
At the rather unpalatable thought<br>
That <i>he'd</i> have to eat<br>
All the left over meat<br>
From the cans of SPAM Lite that he'd bought.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

285.<br>
He racked his brain trying to sort<br>
Out the problem in which he was caught.<br>
"Yes!  I'll use this SPAM meat<br>
To construct--what a treat!--<br>
A dolly with which to cavort!"<br>

The pink morsels quickly were wrought<br>
Into the shape that Igor sought;<br>
And he used up as well<br>
The gloppy SPAM gel<br>
In the intimate parts that were taut!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

287.<br>
As he slid himself on his consort<br>
Igor loudly exclaimed with a snort,<br>
"Oh yes!  Now we're talking!<br>
This is better than porking<br>
That Taiwanese rubber import!"<br>

288.<br>
They eloped to a sun-baked resort<br>
But the romance was sadly cut short.<br>
Dolly sizzled, turned brown<br>
And was swiftly gulped down<br>
By a huge sumo wrestler named Mort.<br>

289.<br>
If I die now my life is complete,<br>
Having rivalled the Olympic elite.<br>
I jumped, vaulted, ran<br>
And threw a SPAM can<br>
One thousand and sixty-nine feet!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

290.<br>
My life to this point was a sham<br>
With my urges pent up like a clam.<br>
But I'm out of the closet<br>
And I'm free now to cosset<br>
My one true love--pink, meaty SPAM!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

291.<br>
Popeye's spinach was switched with canned ham.<br>
He swallowed it down and then--WHAM!<br>
All his limbs turned to rubber<br>
And he started to blubber,<br>
"I yam what I yam... and that's SPAM!"<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

292.<br>
With the force of a runaway tram,<br>
Bluto slammed Popeye's head in the jamb;<br>
Hit that poor sailor man<br>
With a 12 ounce SPAM can<br>
Till he bleated, "Please, stop!", like a lamb.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

293.<br>
The big pig said "Come on, let's scram!"<br>
And led the rest out on the lam.<br>
But these rebels on fire<br>
Misjudged human ire.<br>
The result--the invention of SPAM.<br>
<address>--Jeff Brewer, Jeff@treadwall.com</address><p>

294.<br>
"Where are <i>you</i> from?" said I, serving SPAM<br>
To a young man from South Vietnam.<br>
His hand shook as he took it<br>
And I'm <i>sure</i> he said "Phuket"<br>
But that's a place in the former <i>Siam</i>.<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

295.<br>
On a binge awhile back I did cram<br>
Full of pan-fried and wonderful SPAM<br>
Till the swelling did start<br>
Palpitating of heart,<br>
And my belly on impulse went, "Blam."<br>
<address>--Stacy Huggins, shuggins@concordnc.com</address><p>

296.<br>
When I hear a strange noise in the night<br>
Just before I switch on the hall light<br>
I struggle to cram<br>
A large can of SPAM<br>
In a sock--it might come to a fight!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

297.<br>
Marine rookies hike with full pack<br>
Then are left all alone in a shack<br>
In the depths of a wood<br>
With no source of food<br>
Except for SPAM meat--watch 'em crack!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

298.<br>
My poor next-door neighbor was quite<br>
Overcome by my generous invite:<br>
"Please join us for tea--<br>
We'll have SPAM fricassee."<br>
His knees knocked and his face turned pale white!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

299.<br>
With over five score to his name,<br>
The SPAMerick is <i>mickman</i>'s domain.<br>
The reason, I guess,<br>
For his matchless success,<br>
Is having SPAM meat for a brain!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>

300.<br>
But lately he's been a bit slack,<br>
Displaying a nonchalant lack<br>
Of concern for the threat<br>
From the increasing set<br>
By yours truly--I'm hot on his track!<br>
<address>--Geoff Holme, Geoff_Holme@vos.stratus.com</address><p>
