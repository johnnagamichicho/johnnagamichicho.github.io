So-called "experts" on Big Foot know damn all!<br>
It's no <font color="RED"><b>relict</b></font> of some extinct 
mammal<br>
But made by Frankenstein<br>
From SPAM meat, tied with twine,<br>
And the heart, spleen, and hide of a camel.<br>

A Scotsman who lived in Wyoming,<br>
Exercising his dog in the <font

Since I lost my job and my prosperity,<br>
I can open SPAM cans with dexterity.<br>
It may not be prime steak<br>
But it's easy to make<br>
And the flies disappear with <font

An artist who lived in Moritz<br>
Suffered often from madness and fits.<br>
He'd rub SPAM on his nose,<br>
When painting a pose,<br>
And sometimes around his armpits.<br>

"Well matured and served on a tray;<br>
Surrounded with chips<br>
And asparagus tips<br>
In the midst of a herbal bouquet."<br>

"SPAM smells," says my friend, Bettie Hogger,<br>
"Like the trainers of some sweaty jogger!"<br>
Everyone who hears this<br>
Says "That's <i>just</i> how it is!"<br>

This "Challenge" of mine makes me curse:<br>
Words are hard and each day they get worse.<br>
When I stay up <i>this</i> late<br>

<i>Anything</i>, let alone a SPAM verse.<br>

I once asked young Father Ignatius<br>
If he'd share our SPAM meal.  He said, "Gracious!<br>
Is it <i>really</i> that late?<br>
M-mm-m, we <i>must</i> make a date..."<br>
(For a priest, he can be quite <font
color="RED"><b>mendacious</b></font>.)<br>

A diamond-encrusted pool cue;<br>
Solid gold taps in the loo;<br>
Champagne drunk from a jar;<br>
SPAM with black caviare...<br>

Said a Dad to his youngsters, "Now scoot!<br>
I just don't have the time to dispute<br>
Whether, if SPAM were slicker,<br>
We'd have won the war quicker.<br>
It's a point that's exceedingly <font

What a crafty scheme of Captain Kirk's<br>
For dealing with factious <font color="RED"><b>Young
Turks</b></font>!<br>
Send them through the transporter<br>
To some place with no water<br>
With just SPAM!  Yes, it's cruel but it works!<br>

Though to some he seemed mawkish and fey,<br>
Andy Warhol was quite <font color="RED"><b>engag&eacute;</b></font>.<br>
He portrayed Campbell's soup,<br>
Not that sickly SPAM goop,<br>
To the folks at Hormel's deep dismay.<br>

Wherever karate is taught<br>
The "Casting the SPAMs" is a sport.<br>
The aim of one's throw<br>

A lonely and sad <font color="RED"><b>troglodyte</b></font><br>
Just <i>one</i> day in the year buys SPAM Lite.<br>

A sweet, little baby name Tommy Black<br>

496. (Jan 31st)<br>
In a dark dungeon outside Dundee,<br>
There were ghosts, ghoulies, and a banshee...<br>

...Though my rivals may sneer, I just smile.<br>
My SPAM verses beat their's by a mile!<br>
When accused of <font color="RED"><b>superbity</b></font><br>
I outdo their acerbity<br>
With my pen fully charged with pure bile.<br>
