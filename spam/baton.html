<center><h1>The SHAM is Retiring!</h1></center>

Having ruled over the SPAM-ku archive since its inception on June 14,
1995, the SPAM Haiku Archive Master (SHAM) is ready to pass on the
torch to a worthy successor.  In effect, he will become a SHAM
emeritus (SHAME).  Anyone who is SERIOUSLY interested in this UNPAID
position, contact the SHAM (<img src="../jync.jpg" border=0">).  Please
explain why you are crazy enough to take on such a task.  Applicants
must have about 10 MB of space on a Web server.  Access to cgi-bin
programming makes the archiving task much simpler, since an automated
submission script already exists.<p>
