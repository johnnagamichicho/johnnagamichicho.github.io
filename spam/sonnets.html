<h1>The SPAM Sonnet (Sponnet) Page</h1>

Inspired by Chris Fishel's <a href="1201-1300.html">spamku
#1207</a>, I added this SPAM sonnet (sponnet) page.

<hr><p>

1.<br>
O SPAM!  O glorious, gelatinous mass!<br>
Let heaven and earth resound with thy praise!<br>
Marbled compote of nose, lips, and ass,<br>
Fried, baked, or raw, served with mayonnaise.<br>
Jonathan Black cannot squelch thy appeal,<br>
Though cubical carcass decay and congeal.<br>
Disturbing haiku by this foul man abounds;<br>
Still, sputtering SPAM is the sweetest of sounds.<br>
Eat it today, or wait till next year--<br>
It's prepared with calcium propionate.<br>
The process of spoilage this serves to abate,<br>
Though effects on the diner remain most unclear.<br>
John Cho, and Booda, and Fishel agree:<br>
SPAM's appeal, the Eternal Mystery.<br>

"Just the place for a SPAM!" the bellman cried<br>
As he landed his blue tin on shore.<br>
The various crew were all sure that he lied<br>
'Cause the SPAM was a creature of lore.<br>
They arrived in the mystic land of Hormel<br>
And to various fates did befell.<br>
The hunt for the SPAM was an uffish affairing<br>
And required a frumious daring.<br>
They sought SPAM with a key, they sought it with care<br>
And sought it with loud, brillig curses.<br>
(Though the story itself takes many more verses)<br>
Suffice it to say that it ends in despair.<br>
They found that pink quarry, take it from me,<br>
But the SPAM <em>was</em> a Boojum, you see.<br>

<em>March, 1521: Magellan makes landfall at Guam.<br>
October, 1995: Guam celebrates its first "Spamboree."</em><p>

Across the vast blue sea, a thousand leagues--and more!<br>
Magellan sailed--sailed west for spices and glory.<br>
(Spices?  Cloves and pepper--could he have known before<br>
The fact, how well these would garnish SPAM?  The story<br>
Does not tell.)  But surely the crew, a miserable<br>
Mix of many tongues, and therefore reminiscent of<br>
Luncheon meat in its diverse and improbable<br>
Origin, would have welcomed SPAM with boundless love<br>
Normally reserved for manna from heaven; but,<br>
Lacking SPAM, lacking even a vision of SPAM,<br>
They suffered hunger, scurvy, death, and mut-<br>
tered dark mutinous thoughts--treason for lack of ham!<br>
So, eating rats, rigging, sawdust, they journeyed into the dark a.m.<br>
Never dreaming the discovery that would become a sovereignty of SPAM.<br>
<address>--David Fleck, dfleck@uog9.uog.edu</address><p>

4.<br>
Shall I compare thee to a can of SPAM?<br>
Thou art more pink and more gelatinous.<br>
Much ill is said about this fine "SPiced hAM"<br>
Yet never is it called keratinous.<br>
Sometime too hard the arteries are made<br>
And often is the heart's beating too dim,<br>
And every glob of fat in time is laid<br>
Upon the waist, for Jenny Craig to trim.<br>
But thy eternal pinkness shall not fade<br>
Nor lose possession of that fat thou earn'd<br>
Nor shall Death brag thy heart attack SPAM made.<br>
When in eternal sloth thy life was burn'd<br>
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see<br>
So long will SPAM's blue cans bring joy to thee.<br>
<address>--Drew W. Saunders, Drew.Saunders@leland.stanford.edu</address><p>

And who am I to guess what lies in you,<br>
Be it the snout of pig, or hoof of lamb,<br>
Or eye of horse, or rump of wanderoo;<br>
I know not what hides deep within you, SPAM.<br>
And it is this infinite mystery<br>
Of roach or beaver's heart or brain or lung<br>
Which tempts and thrills and tantalizes me<br>
As I explore your taste upon my tongue.<br>
Minced beyond recognition!  Why, you might<br>
Be Great-aunt whatzername (God bless her soul)!<br>
Your salt, your sweet remains, in every bite<br>
A secret, safely shrouded in your bowl.<p>

How might I know, if, someday soon, I am<br>
Passed for plain, pickled pork in someone's SPAM?<br>
<address>--Hopewish</address><p>

6.<br>
O!  SPAM, thy glories always manifest,<br>
In pinkish mass, and jelly shim'ring sweet<br>
Atop unfathm'd mystery of meat<br>
Encased in tin your honesty is truest<br>
Tin.  Your meekness Christ-like seems to me,<br>
Almighty grandeur clothed in lowly flesh<br>
And somehow uncorrupted, sinless, fresh<br>
Preservatives your immortality<br>
And yet I know you aren't my Savior King,<br>
Your sacrifice for me would be in vain,<br>
Your unkosher carnation flesh too profane,<br>
Your unclean parts can no atonement bring.<br>
Your virtues can idolatry lead to<br>
But I will worship Christ, and eat of you.<br>
<address>--Anonymous</address><p>

They say that SPAM saved Russia in World War II;<br>
It kept the Red Army from falling apart.<br>
The GIs in France, they were given SPAM, too.<br>
No flamethrowers needed; they had burning farts.<br>
To the besieged British SPAM brought quick relief.<br>
(Although, by the end, they were longing for beef.)<br>
Chinese and Egyptians, Italians and Slavs<br>
All partook of pork and gelatinous globs.<br>
The Maquis got SPAM, at first to their disdain,<br>
But SPAM had uses that Hormel never planned. <br>
It's true; as a food it was hopelessly bland<br>
But put it on tracks, it could derail a train.<br>
Marines on the beaches of Tarawa knew:<br>
When out of grenades, throw some SPAM.  That'll do!<br>
<address>--Bob Roberds, broberds@ix.netcom.com</address><p>

8. (Acrostic)<br>
The puzzle is indigestion to the mind:<br>
How might we give a meaning to this treat,<br>
A pinkish thing in fat that looks like slime<br>
That dripped from maws of movie aliens?  This meat<br>
Has every dieter's craving sure to be<br>
Only for a thing to kill the smell;<br>
Reducers, take good note!  And should one see<br>
Morsels of tainted seafood made one ill,<br>
Everybody knows that SPAM's the best,<br>
Least costly purgative from nature's gifts.<br>
Savants think of its essence and digress:<br>
Proof, they say, that hell really exists.<br>
All in all, what means this slew of evidence?<br>
Mostly: if you touch it, soap and rinse.<br>
<address>--Will Briggs</address><p>

9.<br>
If SPAM were morning, dawn would bring on screams;<br>
The bright blue sun would frighten all with eyes.<br>
If afternoon as well were Hormel's prize,<br>
I think the can would start to open, streams<br>
Of viscous goo descending.  Yet it seems<br>
This would not be, to most, a nice surprise.<br>
Nor SPAMset, pink meat loosed from its tin guise,<br>
Glowing in the west with greasy beams.<br>
Could any time be SPAM and make us glad?<br>
At midnight, when the soul can not find rest,<br>
In the dim refrigerator glow,<br>
That time is SPAM.  Each late-night snack you've had,<br>
Lacking all panache, all trace of zest--<br>
They fed this time.  There is no place to go.<br>
<address>--Francis Heaney, francis.heaney@tglbbs.com</address><p>

Odysseus, riding the crest of the white-plumed waves,<br>
Upon the banks of the new continent did descend.<br>
Set booted foot upon the path, which to glory paves<br>
The way.  And yet, upon the wind his nostrils to offend<br>
Did rise a perfume, richer than the hoards of Midas.<br>
(And did not his hunger for earthly wealth exceed<br>
The passion of pork's embrace by labial mass?)<br>
But lo!  The hero, nausea stifled, the scent did heed.<br>
Many days and countless nights did last his quest,<br>
Until his eyes, clouded from the odiferous<br>
Swine, upon the distant azure tin did come to rest.<br>
Among the snow-capped peaks and trees coniferous.<br>
And never was such passion known to god or to man,<br>
As the mariner engaging in the Joy of SPAM.<br>
<address>--Matthew Gertner, matthew@poet.de</address><p>

11.<br>
Encased in metal coffin and preserved<br>
With myriad artificial chemicals<br>
The pinkish flesh is saved and later served<br>
In small, convenient, bite-sized particles.<br>
But, oh!, the price at which this meal is bought!<br>
A thousand screaming piglets trapped inside--<br>
Suspended, gleaming, in an oily clot<br>
Just waiting, waiting to be eaten fried.<br>
The dark blue coffin, locked with metal key,<br>
Can only hide the violence for so long,<br>
And when it's opened, frightened eyes shall see<br>
The slaughtered thousands in their greasy throng.<br>
O meat!  Thou thing, thou aspirant to ham!<br>
With horror paralyzed we name thee SPAM!<br>
<address>--Jamis Buck, buck@cs.byu.edu</address><p>

12.<br>
As pink as was a pig, and yet more soft<br>
and gentle than the swine's most coarse of hides.<br>
I held the quiv'ring lump aloft<br>
and gazed upon its beauty from all sides.<br>
'Tis slimy like a slug--yet smooth as silk<br>
As smooth as any fabric come to mind.<br>
I would my mother'd fed me not her milk<br>
but rather this of delicacies fine.<br>
It radiates an air misunderstood--<br>
that some perceive this foodstuff contraband<br>
when really it embodies best in food.<br>
Wait for economists to understand<br>
it's got more worth than spice from far Siam.<br>
You keep your gold and rubies--I'll choose SPAM.<br>
<address>--Rowan Lipkovits, valentine@infomatch.com</address><p>

13.<br>
What use could then befit such bricklike meat?<br>
Its malleable texture is no chance.<br>
For those of you who choose it not to eat<br>
you'll find that there are many greater plans.<br>
Could not its claylike texture fashion pots?<br>
A sculptor's chisel, knife, or even spork<br>
could free a shape before the artwork rots.<br>
It stops your bottles when shaped like a cork.<br>
Construction, then?  A house made out of it?<br>
Well-insulated, and with what a view!<br>
Once settled in, you wouldn't mind a bit.<br>
Or spin it into laces for a shoe.<br>
Or thread to make a coat soft as a lamb!<br>
Now aren't you glad we've got this resource--SPAM?<br>
<address>--Rowan Lipkovits, valentine@infomatch.com</address><p>

14.<br>
Oh foul and trait'rous villain Spam, thou art,<br>
Whom once I held more dearly in esteem<br>
Than life itself, and blessed each noble fart<br>
That from my colon to the heav'ns didst beam.<br>
To think, our sacred union now cut short<br>
By dietary mandates from on high.<br>
Oh weep not, South American export,<br>
For were we not to part, I'd surely die!<br>
Though gentle on my tongue and on my lips<br>
Your residue bides sweet, and satiates,<br>
Yet cellulite profoundly swells my hips,<br>
And in my veins and bowels, canc'rous nitrates.<br>
Alas! We part my love, but pray thee, mind:<br>
When you speak of this (and you will), be kind!<br>
<address>--James P. Hinkley, james@datatree.com</address><p>

15.<br>
Spiced ham!  Pork product wonderful thou art!<br>
Pork shoulder, ham, with salt and nitrate, thee.<br>
Pink flesh within a can.  No snout, no heart,<br>
No offal are within thy pedigree.<br>
Both Russia, England thou didst feed when meat<br>
Familiar scarce became.  Americans<br>
Took hogs and butchered them and cooked with heat<br>
Producing SPAM to nourish foreign lands.<br>
Thy goodness is not measured by thy length<br>
Or color.  Yet to me thy worth is clear.<br>
Consumed, thou, SPAM, becomes my joy and strength.<br>
So why do others ridicule and jeer?<br>
'Tis sacrilege to think this food not great!<br>
For none but SPAM can so my hunger sate!<br>
<address>--Vincent Woolf, vincent@crown.as.utexas.edu</address><p>

16.<br>
I'd like to eat a giant plate of SPAM,<br>
With sev'ral friends at Eddie's Bar and Grill;<br>
That Eddie makes some tasty "Not-Quite-Ham,"<br>
Which I will eat until I've had my fill.<br>
Some say that SPAM is used to torture men,<br>
By feeding it to them until they die;<br>
But when it's near I always have a yen<br>
For hearty portions of a good SPAM pie.<br>
Not everyone can like the stuff like me;<br>
Not everyone can eat it every day.<br>
And so I think they'll never really see<br>
That eating it makes life so much more gay.<br>
If you've tried SPAM you know this must be right:<br>
Who e'er loved SPAM, that loved not at first bite?<br>
<address>--Ben Tallen</address><p>

17.<br>
Thy porcine pink doth taste of MSG,<br>
and lie upon my plate exuding juice.<br>
O wond'rous world that brings such treats to me,<br>
I'm thankful that it's pink and not bright puce.<br>
From the can you were untimely ripped,<br>
and sliced and grilled and served to me for lunch.<br>
The hand of hunger on my stomach gripped,<br>
I found I liked it!  Yes indeed, a bunch!<br>
O marvelous pop-top can of square design,<br>
ooze forth thy meaty goodness, yea, forthwith.<br>
Fill my stomach growling, soothe my mind,<br>
mum mumble wif ma mouf full, ids suth blith.<br>
From up in Minnesota Hormel ships<br>
the finest treat to pass o'er human lips.<br>
Though internetters make its sound a shame,<br>
Sing Spamallelujah!  Praise unto your name!<br>

I would your spirit were a single mass<br>
Of undivided uniformity<br>
Pink as the rash of roses on the grass<br>
Whose nectars call the self-involving bee.<br>
And, true, when I first knew you, something like<br>
A flush ran through you--and a sudden hue<br>
Bowed, glowing, like the shadow of a pike<br>
Beneath thick waters.  All seemed one, and true.<br>
But now I see you have a soul of SPAM;<br>
Those waters are a jelly, long-lathed down<br>
In which the pike drowns, fin-in-hoof with ham.<br>
And your pink flush--a chemical-made gown--<br>
Tints what is grey, by rights--and your tin warms<br>
In far blue, body pressed into the Forms.<br>
<address>--ryan underwood</address><p>

19.<br>
What is this odd meat?<br>
Is it torso, snout, or feet?<br>
It's SPAM, I tell you, SPAM.<br>
I've heard it's almost ham.<br>
SPAM is very spiced.<br>
I've eaten it more than twice.<br>
SPAM is extremely good when sliced;<br>
It's even better when it's diced.<br>
SPAM, O SPAM,<br>
I highly respect you.<br>
If you take my SPAM,<br>
The day I will rue.<br>
Maybe it is something from my shoes.<br>
SPAM is a trademark of Hormel Foods.<br>
<address>--Jeffrey Gerard, ThePiMan@juno.com</address><p>

20.<br>
There is a dim upon your once-bright eye<br>
As though my leaning to you fogged a pane--<br>
By what?  You whose bright looking found no bane<br>
Before, who took all in, and would not die,<br>
Falter, and fold on fold of strange fumes ply<br>
Between us.  Loved one, let this clotted stain<br>
Not swaddle love.  Loved one, loved heart, explain!<br>
Explain, and I will leave you happily.<br>
"There is a difference now upon your breath<br>
And when you lean to me, you reek of death<br>
Made jolly, in a pocketable bunch.<br>
My sight--my sight is fogged with hearts untold<br>
Wreathed in your speaking--many--and long cold...<br>
Old love, why did you eat that SPAM at lunch?"<br>
<address>--ryan underwood</address><p>

21.<br>
What is that meat sitting up on the shelf?  <br>
This canned meal has brought Hormel Foods great wealth. <br>
So good I can eat the whole can myself, <br>
Brilliant fluorescent pink and full of stealth. <br>
It tastes so good in such a tiny can <br>
It should be in its very own food group. <br>
I know I must be their number one fan, <br>
Eat it in sandwiches, raw or in soup. <br>
The can sparkles like a bright morning star, <br>
Found in Aisle Four, creamed corn just next door. <br>
Small and compact and it fits in your car, <br>
Take just one bite and you'll want plenty more. <br>
This great meat we speak of cannot be lamb, <br>
Smushed into that tiny can, of course, it's SPAM!<br>
<address>--Katherine Wallace</address><p>

22.<br>
I languished in a supermarket aisle<br>
Rubber thongs upon my bunioned feet<br>
When to my careworn face there crept a smile,<br>
As I beheld my favorite processed meat.<br>
No longer did the locked wheel of my cart<br>
Nor lack of Seagram's Seven Crown dismay<br>
And lo, I felt despondency depart<br>
As on those tins, fluorescent light did play.<br>
The frying pan upon my hot plate's glow<br>
Would lend its sizzling fragrance to the air<br>
And I would watch the Jerry Springer Show<br>
And know at last some respite from despair.<br>
For prone to melancholy though I am,<br>
Happiness, to me thy name is SPAM.<br>
<address>--Michael Drumm</address><p>

23.<br>
The death of summer, that hot oppressive thing,<br>
Left nothing for me to do or say<br>
To make fresh food (like I had in spring)<br>
When broccoli and peas took hunger away.<br>
Now cold, the wind will take my joys<br>
And slow, no lunch meat, passing endless nights.<br>
Echoes of frying fat my mind destroys<br>
As beef and cheddar's semblance fade from sight.<br>
Against all odds I wait for its return,<br>
But never will pot roast come, although I wait.<br>
The pork I ate, and didn't eat, will burn<br>
While stomach acid makes proteins separate.<br>
Batter my soul and end these dreams of ham,<br>
Deliver to me a vacuum-sealed can of SPAM!<p>
<address>--William Ames</address><p>

24.<br>
Devouring SPAM does blunt kids' appetites;<br>
I try to force this pink junk on my brood.<br>
They pluck it from their teeth with great delight,<br>
And tell me they are just not in the mood.<br>
I try to inspire love for Hormel's meats;<br>
Faced with starvation, they'll chow down in time.<br>
"SPAM is Brit'ny Spears' most favorite eats!"<br>
I tell them as they out their chairs do climb.<br>
"O carve not SPAM for us," my children bleat,<br>
"Nor fry this food we can't identify."<br>
"Four centuries from now, still fresh will be that meat,<br>
The wrath of Time will Hormel's cans defy."<br>
If things had gone all wrong for Y2K,<br>
My children would be craving SPAM today.<br>
<address>--Maxzmomliz@aol.com</address><p>

25.<br>
What hath this shape that stands before me now?<br>
Not rectangle, sphere, nor is it a cone.<br>
You are piggish, although not like a cow,<br>
Resting inside of your blue metal home.<br>
Your fragrence cannot be moved from the air<br>
And I know not who would do such a thing.<br>
What a shame for you to be trapped in there.<br>
Shall I pull on your silver metal ring?<br>
Oh, you are of the highest quality.<br>
It is true I have tried all of the brands,<br>
And shelf life does not let you turn faulty.<br>
You can be taken to faraway lands.<br>
People all over should forsake their ham,<br>
And only eat the wonderful canned SPAM!<br>
<address>--Boots</address><p>

26.<br>
At dusk my craving wings do fly to heights<br>
Above what hands could struggling reach from bed<br>
Or foot or toe would clumsily fast shed<br>
(If kicks could reach so high) from crevice tight,<br>
The treasure often seen in dreams, when night<br>
Has given what high shelves keep close as wed,<br>
Tightly crammed, held fast, so none are fed,<br>
Those midnight glowing cans of blue so bright.<br>
But rise?  Not I from weedy stupor.  Nay.<br>
Unused thus far in my brief stay, from hand<br>
This broom shall find by aim and God its way,<br>
Unchecked to cupboard still with dust, as spear<br>
To hidden corner flies, its thrust knocks near<br>
This food, my mortal fantasy, dear SPAM.<br>
<address>--Mike Falcon, mfalcon@adiyh.com</address><p>

27.<br>
O! SPAM! thou art so spammish and true,<br>
You come packaged so neat, and clean,<br>
The nutrition facts are well hidden: You are not lean.<br>
You are famous for that tin, that chariot of blue.<br>
But once the sterile seal is broken, all is now pink.<br>
Pink meat, pink goo, and all of it is unclean, blemished.<br>
Reminded of the creater of SPAM, that horrible chemist.<br>
We are forced to take a cautious nibble, so as not to be a fink.<br>
O! the delight! the delicious satin of the meat!<br>
All hard feelings are abandoned as we enjoy the taste!<br>
O! Hormel! your meat gives us such pleasure!<br>
Let us all open our own personal chariots and eat!<br>
We use our suave plastic forks to mash it to a paste,<br>
And we thank the good Lord for providing such treasure!<br>
<address>--Michael McLachlan</address><p>

28.<br>
O SPAM, thy four letters are contrived<br>
To mock my late evenings<br>
Alone among the canned meat items of aisle five!<br>
Thy porcine countenance and frock as blue as daylight leaving,<br>
As distant and coy as the moon,<br>
Shine down a cold and captivating gloom.<br>
Dare I forsake thee for the ambitious<br>
Boasts, the abject preening<br>
Of another's insistent petitions?<br>
None is as mysterious, as joyfully demeaning.<br>
O SPAM if you could only smile,<br>
Purchase me and cart me away from this dungeon of dirt-encrusted, rutted tile!<br>
How much would I love to see<br>
That meal your imagination would envision as a feast for thou and me.<br>
<address>--Sean Carman, cosimo@mindspring.com</address><p>

29.<br>
Oh SPAM!  A metaphor for the masses,<br>
As the pork product pressed into a can,<br>
Restriction will not make the people wan,<br>
No room to grow for the lower classes.<br>
Squashed pork, like the urban lad and lasses<br>
Shapes not itself but is shaped in a plan<br>
For the convenience of the ruling clan.<br>
The plebians cry out injustices!<br>
And then the proletariats will rise.<br>
The can opener will release the SPAM<br>
And like the people, spam is free to roam<br>
And for repression it is the demise<br>
For the restrained are no longer crammed<br>
The gelatinous pink calls freedom home.<br>

On Eating SPAM for Christmas<p>
When unimpressed with turkey and mince pies,<br>
I all alone beweep my outcast state,<br>
And curse fat Santa with ungrateful cries,<br>
And look on tasteless gifts from folks I hate,<br>
Wishing I had the riches I have not,<br>
Futures like him, like him of funds possess'd,<br>
Desiring this man's wife, and that man's yacht,<br>
With what I most enjoy presented least:<br>
Yet in these thoughts the season most despising,<br>
Haply I dine on SPAM,--and then my state<br>
(Like to some butterfly of hope arising<br>
From misty dusk) sings carols at God's gate;<br>
For on sweet SPAM I dine with such trimmings<br>
That I relish Christmas joy's o'erbrimmings.<br>

"Let me not to the contents of thy can"<p>
Let me not to the contents of thy can<br>
Add any condiments.  SPAM is not SPAM<br>
When altered by unbalanced minds,<br>
Or flaked when the remover doth remove:<br>
O no; it is the ever-fixed pork,<br>
Uncooked, ungarnished, and by Time undinted;<br>
It is like gold to every plundering fork,<br>
Whose worth's unknown, although its price be printed.<br>
SPAM's not uncool, though rosy-hued and cheap<br>
And from it oily trickles constant come;<br>
SPAM alters not, doth neither wake nor sleep,<br>
Its worth cries out though it be deaf and dumb.<br>
If this be error, and such claims a sham,<br>
Ne'er have I writ, and ne'er man ate of SPAM.<br>

On His SPAMlessness<p>
When I consider how my SPAM is spent<br>
Ere half my time in this lunch hour's gone by,<br>
And thirty minutes left I sit and cry<br>
Longingly SPAMless, though my soul be bent<br>
To be served with more, "Waitress," I relent<br>
With gloomy frown, when she returns apace,<br>
"Do you accept Mastercard in this place?"<br>
I fondly ask.  But Waitress, to prevent<br>
That murmur, soon replies, "We hath not need<br>
Of anything except hard cash.  Who fails<br>
To tender such, we serve him not.  I'll state<br>
It plain.  Yet thousands to our diner speed.<br>
For though all cards of plastic we reject,<br>
We also serve the only SPAM in state."<br>

On A Collapsed SPAM Display at Food Lion<p>
Avenge, O Lord, thy fallen SPAMs, that now<br>
Lie scattered in the aisle of Food Lion cold;<br>
Even them whose sell-by date was not yet old,<br>
Whose fall leaves us to dine on bird and cow,<br>
Forget not: in thy book record this chow<br>
That was thy SPAM, that from its tin tower bold<br>
Beside the bloody Birdseye Peas, has rolled<br>
Tumbling instant from the stocks, and how<br>
The store resounded with the clangs that left<br>
Them dented.  Their punctured metal armor goes<br>
To trash.  And dallying in this store bereft,<br>
My triple coupons do I clutch and moan<br>
Such wonderful SPAM, now thrown away,<br>
And checkout counter bathe with tears of woe.<br>

On First Looking into Hormel's SPAM<p>
Much have I eaten out of silver cans,<br>
And many goodly meals and soups consumed;<br>
Downed tasty treats from many pots and pans<br>
And breads and jams and condiments perfumed.<br>
But of food less expensive I'd been told<br>
That one proud Hormel tinned for wartime ration<br>
Yet did I never taste this porcine dream<br>
Till my can ope'ner raised its lid, Behold!<br>
Then felt I like some lawyer on the rise<br>
When fast-food client stings with coffee burn;<br>
Or like stout Clinton, who with evil eyes,<br>
Ogling specifics of his new intern<br>
Smiled to himself at a wild surmise<br>
Silent, with just a peek, in Washington.<br>

Bright SPAM<p>
Bright SPAM, would I were wholesome as thou prove--<br>
Set in pink splendor, squeezed within thy can<br>
And waiting, with th'infernal lid removed,<br>
Like Jack K's patient, sleepless in a van,<br>
While sullen waiters at their priestlike task<br>
Of distribution tread cheap caf&eacute; floors.<br>
And gazing on thy new soft oily face<br>
Of SPAM, for which I'll hunger evermore,<br>
Thou yet still wholesome, scarce perishable,<br>
Pillow'd within thy ever sparkling metal,<br>
I wish for ever thy soft porcine smell,<br>
To whiff for ever in a sweet unrest,<br>
Still, SPAM to sniff with tender-taken breath,<br>
With SPAM life ever and without SPAM, death.<br>

When I Have Fears<p>
When I have fears that I may cease to eat<br>
Before my fork has glean'd all processed ham,<br>
While yet high-piled shelves in groceries,<br>
Hold like rich garners the full unopen'd SPAM;<br>
When I behold, upon some billboard bright,<br>
Huge cloudy symbols of thou, pink entr&eacute;e,<br>
And think that I may never live to bite<br>
Thy tasty substance at the end of day;<br>
And when, fair Helen of the luncheon hour,<br>
I fear I'll never dine upon thee more,<br>
No more pour relish on thy porcine power<br>
Of undigested stodge;--then on the floor<br>
Of the Food World I fetal lie, and bleat<br>
Till management removes me to the street.<br>

I went for dinner at a cheap cafe<br>
And got: Two vast and tasteless chunks of SPAM<br>
Plonked in a salad . . . Near them, croutons lay<br>
Half sunk, a carrot frigid peered, and down,<br>
Beneath it smears of coleslaw cold and gray,<br>
Told the preparer worked for minimum wage<br>
But to survive, swamped by green wilting things.<br>
His hands had cut them, that my greed be fed:<br>
Yet on the menu still these words appeared:<br>
"Please try our Caesar Salad, King of Kings"<br>
Look on these words, ye diners, and despair!<br>
I cannot hide my pain.  In my dismay<br>
I clutch on my receipt, soundless and stare.<br>
I moan and sadly hand them back the tray.<br>

Despised flesh!  Pink sweaty Jell-O sheen;<br>
Unnatural condensation, dewy bead<br>
Of porcine adipose.  But no hogs feed<br>
On such as makes this meat not fat nor lean.<br>
It can't be pork: what other cut is seen<br>
To be so red when yet it does not bleed?<br>
No chicken, this, not beef, not veal indeed!<br>
I eat: two gristled bites, a trance between--<br>
The horror in Hormela, the bright machine<br>
Dispensing, unattended, can by can,<br>
The applicants are hired, though weak and feeble.<br>
--Another salty forkful, vision flees.<br>
But memory nags: A screaming, frantic man;<br>
"Soylent Green is made of people!"<br>

Out there, we've walked quite coolly to the can;<br>
Sat down and eaten of it, cool and bland,<br>
Slurped from the spilling pull-tins in our hand.<br>
We've sniffed the thick pink odor of its ham--<br>
Our eyes wept, but our hunger didn't budge.<br>
It spat at us while frying and it coughed<br>
Mucus.  We chorused as its smells aloft<br>
Did waver, and the lumps congealed in sludge.<br>
Oh, SPAM was never enemy of ours!<br>
We nibbled him, we gobbled him, old chum.<br>
No gourmand's paid to kick against his powers.<br>
We laughed, knowing that better food would come,<br>
And greater cans: when each proud eater scoffs<br>
He wars on SPAM--for life; not tins--for toffs.<br>
