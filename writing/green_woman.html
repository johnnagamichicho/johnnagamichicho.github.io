<h1>Kiss of the Green Woman</h1>

To avoid the kiss of the green woman one must:<p>
 
1. Lie down with the purple woman until her dolorous haze cloaks your
shiny humor.<p>

2. Collect five fresh hairballs from your cat and arrange them
symmetrically around your futon.<p>

3. Quit your job on one day's notice and move to a village where a
baobab tree can be sighted in the four cardinal directions.<p>

4. Dream of swirling snowflakes, each identical to the other.<p>

5. Fly a kite with the face of the green woman embossed on its crisp,
silvery surface.<p>

6. Drink a pint of pomegranate juice squeezed by the well-worn hands
of a barren woman.<p>

7. Learn to play the accordion or the bagpipe; play only dirges and
sea shanties.<p>

8. Lie down repeatedly with women of non-green hue until your stripes
are blurred.<p>

9. Laugh no more than four times a day, no less than twice; you may
cry, but only if your stomach is full.<p>

10. Tell the truth exactly 50 percent of the time.<p>

11. Write bad poetry about artichokes and displaced horizons.<p>

12. Never, ever, turn around if you hear a whisper uncovered
momentarily by a lull in the winds.<p>
