<h1>Anagrammatic Poems</h1>

It all began for me in Sierra Leone, 1987.  Reading and writing by
kerosene lantern light at night, I suddenly hit upon the idea of
creating anagrams of RONALD WILSON REAGAN, our unfathomably two-term
President back home.  666, as some people claimed, he must have had
some kind of magic to have mesmerized the American people into voting
for him while blithely running up the national debt.<p>

So I constructed a few lame anagrams and proposed a contest in <em>Di
News De</em>, the Peace Corps/Sierra Leone bimonthly rag.  There were
several responses in the next issue, but we were all blown away by
this masterpiece by a British Council worker in Makeni:<p>

<h2>Ronald Wilson Reagan: An Ode</h2>

<em>(To be read in stirring, declamatory tones without particular regard for
veracity or meaning, in a manner of an old Hollywood actor reading his
lines.)</em><p>

A long insane warlord,<br>
Insane Golan warlord...<br>
As a lion, Ron wrangled.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Danger!  An ill war soon.<br>
Ill war rages on and on,<br>
A long, lean SDI war, Ron.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Ron draws along a line.<br>
A long Ron leads in war,<br>
War alone, darling son.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Ron: a lewd slogan: Iran.<br>
Iran allows no danger,<br>
Allow Iran no gardens.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Regal London saw Iran.<br>
Iran warns gold alone.<br>
Sell a dog now, ran Iran.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

No wars: Ron gained all.<br>
Was all Ron gained Ron?<br>
Lo!  Ron's law in danger,<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Now an order gains all.<br>
I, Don, ran no legal wars.<br>
Ron, law is an old anger.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Will Ron anger as a Don?<br>
Lo!  No darn Regan wails!<br>
No laird!  No Regan laws!<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad.<p>

Warn Ron: all AIDS gone,<br>
An Ollie drawn groans,<br>
A raw girl and low son.<br>
Lean Ron is a wrong lad,<br>
A nadir song worn leal.<p>

Since then I have written a few anagrammatic poems myself, but I have
to admit none have been as good as the one above.  Here are a few
examples:<p>

<h2>Colleen Marie Kirby</h2>

In reliable mockery<br>
Rollick ye bare mien.<br>
I'll embrace or ink ye--<br>
Rob ire, my lilac keen.<p>

I bare more lily neck,<br>
I kneel o'er racy limb.<br>
My broken Eire lilac,<br>
I rebel like acronym.<p>

I, malice, broken lyre,<br>
Only lie, irk, embrace.<br>
Rock--belie manly ire,<br>
My rib or like enlace.<p>

Lick or lie by me near,<br>
Lie rimy, broken lace;<br>
Nor label me icy Kier,<br>
I roll in key embrace.<p>

Rein back, my Lorelei,<br>
<em>Mi reina</em>, rocky <em>belle</em>.<br>
Be my link, care or lie,<br>
Ere I comb airy knell.<p>

Ere I brick loyal men,<br>
I reck only rebel aim.<br>
By realm I lie, reckon,<br>
I cry or keel in blame.<p>

<h2>DIANE MARIE HARRIS: An Anagrammatic
Operetta</h2>

For mezzo-soprano, baritone, and SATB chorus<p>

(Libretto edition)<p>

<h3>Act II. Scene 1.</h3>

<em>[Synopsis: Dan de Man (baritone), a long-time admirer of Diana
d'Millvilles (mezzo), has finally decided to ask for her hand in
marriage.  He comes to her resolutely but, in her radiant presence,
loses his nerve and prattles on about marginal topics.  What he does
not know is that Diana, impatient with his indecisiveness, has agreed
to be betrothed to Ian, a rich but entirely shallow heir to the ACME
Plumbing empire.  And the engagement notice is in the The Times which
is just arriving...]</em><p>

Baritone:<br>
	Rare is maidenhair!<br>
	I admire her as rain.<br>
	I aid her arm as rein.<br>
	Maidenhair is rare!<p>

	Maidenhair is rare!<br>
	I desire an arm hair.<br>
	I rain; he dreams air.<br>
	Rare is maidenhair!<p>

Baritone:<br>
	I, Dan, her aim raiser.<br>
	I am her raid an' sire.<br>
	I, Dan, hear a rim's ire.<br>
	I am her sad Rainier.<p>

Chorus:<br>
	Rare is maidenhair!<br>
	A dreamer is in hair.<br>
	He dreams in air--air!<br>
	Maidenhair is rare.<p>

Mezzo:<br>
	Hi, dreamer (as I rain)!<br>
	I rinse a dream hair.<br>
	Hi!  Rein-arm is a dare.<br>
	He dreams air; I, rain.<p>

Baritone:<br>
	Her aim is a rare din.<br>
	I am her dear raisin.<br>
	I am her rare sin aid.<br>
	Her saner aim I raid.<p>

	I admire a rare shin.<br>
	I am her dear air sin.<br>
	I harm a rain desire,<br>
	I raid a ramen shire!<p>

Chorus:<br>
	I raid a ramen shire,<br>
	Her saner aim I raid.<br>
	I said, "A ramen hirer,"<br>
	Her rain airs I made.<p>

Mezzo:<br>
	I rinse a dream hair,<br>
	I dream rain is hare.<br>
	In dream, raise hair;<br>
	I share dream in air.<p>

Baritone:<br>
	I smear a drain heir!<br>
	Admire her sin aria!<br>
	I, ash.  I render Maria.<br>
	Diana marries heir!<p>

Chorus:<br>
	A!  Di marries an heir!<br>
	Her air-dream is Ian.<br>
	Air-head marries in.<br>
	Maidenhair is rare!<p>

Baritone:<br>
	Her rain drain is me.<br>
	I hear dream is rain.<br>
	I am her raised rain.<br>
	Her nadir aria is me.<p>

<h2>Silicon Graphics Incorporated</h2>

<em>In response to an SGI contest that called for a statement 25 words
or less, which explained why you wanted to win the first-place prize
of an SGI Indy computer.</em><p>

Rococo PC trashed, nil.  Aspiring, I<br>
Incorporate iron-clad chips--SGI.<br>
I plot in accord, I graph in scores;<br>
I clip, chop, grind--reaction soars.<p>

(I still wonder why I didn't win--how can you beat an AABB
anagrammatic poem with exactly 25 words?)<p>
