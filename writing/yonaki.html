<h1>Yonaki Soba</h1>

Recently a late-night <em>ramen</em> spot has been popping up in various
upscale Boston eateries and bars.  Guchi's Midnight Ramen announces
its peripatetic incarnation via tweets, and, so far, on-line tickets
to these sporadic events have sold out within fifteen seconds.  I
know, because I have amended my troglodyte ways by opening a Twitter
account just so that I could vie for a chance to try a bowl.<p>

<em>Ramen</em> in Boston is not rare or particularly noteworthy, but l
have a special place in my memory for late-night <em>ramen</em> from
my childhood years in Tokyo, where, as night deepens, the city becomes
populated by <em>yatai</em> (mobile food stands).  They cater mainly
to salarymen and laborers leaving late from work, who, either alone or
with co-workers, stop by to have a drink or two and a snack to help
them decompress before heading home. <em>Yakitori</em> (grilled
chicken skewers) and <em>oden</em> (seafood and vegetable stew) are
common, as are <em>yonaki soba</em> carts.  The latter
serve <em>ramen</em>, and one such cart used to station itself right
in front of our house.  It was easy to tell when it arrived, because
the proprietor would play while pulling his cart the
traditional <em>yonaki</em> tune (G-A-B---A-G, G-A-B-A-G-A---) on
the <em>charumera</em> (from the Portuguese <em>charmela</em>, a
double-reed instrument that sounds like the Turkish <em>zurna</em>) to
advertise the fact.  ("Charumera" is also one of the oldest brand
names of instant <em>ramen</em> in Japan.)  On occasional weekend
nights or during vacation when I was allowed to stay up later than
usual, I eagerly awaited the gastronomic siren song to approach from a
distance.  When the simple three-note melody ceased, I knew that it
was time to go outside.  As my mother did not trust the sanitary
conditions of the mobile cart, she always made me take my own bowl
from the kitchen cupboard.<p>

A large part of the <em>yonaki soba</em> attraction is watching the
step-by-step process of your <em>ramen</em> being assembled.  When the order is
placed, the chef deposits a handful of kinky yellow noodles, fragrant
with <em>kansui</em>, into a vat of boiling water.  He then puts a dollop of
<em>tare</em> (soy-sauce-based seasoning fluid) into the empty bowl
along with a heaping teaspoon of MSG.  Then he ladles steaming
translucent broth redolent of pork and chicken bones from another vat
into the bowl.  After a minute, he scoops out the single helping of
noodles from the bubbling water with a large wire-mesh skimmer and
lets it settle into the bowl of flavored broth.  The swirl and flip of
the skimmer to dredge and wring out excess water from the perfectly
done noodle nest is economical and elegant, like a French chef
swooshing out an omelette with a few flicks of the wrist.  He loosens
the tangle of noodles and equilibrates them with the broth with a few
deft chopstick pokes.<p>

Now comes my favorite part.  From a wooden cabinet full of drawers he
removes a hunk of aromatic <em>chaashuu</em> (Chinese-style roast
pork), blanched spinach, <em>naruto kamaboko</em> (serrated
cylindrical fish cake with the characteristic pink spiral), rectangles
of <em>nori</em>, and scallions.  (The spinach is a peculiarity of
this <em>yatai</em>--the "veggie" topping is more
typically <em>menma</em>, fermented bamboo shoots.)  The cabinet is
mysterious; I imagine the topping ingredients being prepped inside by
Lilliputian line cooks who scurry to hide when the head chef reaches
for a drawer.  The cabinet also has a dark side; I think of
the <em>yonaki</em> chef working in nearby Nishinippori who was
astonished to find a freshly severed pinkie instead
of <em>chaashuu</em> on his first drawer pull of the night.  It may
have been an urban legend, but you never know with
the <em>yakuza</em>.<p>

Rapidly and smoothly the chef carves out a few thin slices from the
<em>chaashuu</em> and <em>naruto</em>, chops a small portion from the
bundled cords of spinach, minces a thimbleful of scallions, and floats
them all in segregated neighborhoods on the surface of the broth.  The
finishing touch is the <em>nori</em> and a shake of ground white
pepper on top.<p>

In my memory it is a warm humid summer night as I bring back the
scalding bowl into the house to eat.  I am in my light
cotton <em>yukata</em> and wearing flip flops.  Perhaps the TV is on
and playing one of those nutty late-night variety shows featuring
garishly dressed comedians and B-list actors.  The <em>ramen</em> is
gloriously delicious, as the privilege of staying up late like an
adult serves as an <em>umami</em> enhancer more powerful than the
abundant MSG.<p>
