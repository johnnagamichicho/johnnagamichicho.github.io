<h1>Freetown Bicentenary, 1987</h1>

Freetown at dusk is almost<br>
beautiful, viewed from above<br>
through the moist sea<br>
atmosphere that softens the focus on<br>
the rust-ravaged zinc<br>
pan roofs and the broken up pavements with their growing<br>
scars and hopeless pock<br>
marks like a photographer who<br>
knows how to shoot a once-<br>
lovely face now stitched<br>
piecemeal from purple<br>
patches.  Directly below<br>
the shadows merge and thicken into<br>
pools of dark<br>
acquiescence lit waveringly<br>
here and there by candles while<br>
the hillsides sparkle with the<br>
white jewels of electricity.<p>

Downtown, the people have emerged to<br>
reclaim the streets from the daytime<br>
occupiers: diplomats, soldiers, and businessmen.<br>
Night is their abode, a period of<br>
respite from the endless heat<br>
of sub-Saharan crises, a time<br>
in which the litany of &quot;No condition<br>
is permanent&quot; is discernible in the blaring<br>
transistor radios and in the sinuously swaying<br>
bodies that respond more to the<br>
garbled music of some distant<br>
dream-like country than to the ponderous pathos<br>
of the here-and-now.  Even the graffito<br>
(&quot;DE AFRICAN TOURIST&quot;) illuminated<br>
by the kerosene lamp of a woman selling<br>
fried sweet potatoes with<br>
fish-pepper sauce<br>
resonates with an ephemeral clairvoyance as if one<br>
transparent night they will simply climb aboard a<br>
long-defunct train and be<br>
carried off to a cooler, stiller dawn.<p>

Down by the Government Wharf, a<br>
prostitute leans out from<br>
a second-storey<br>
window, smoking a filterless<br>
Tabaca, gazing listlessly at nothing.<br>
A dog pauses below,<br>
sniffing at the remains of a lizard.<br>
Out on the bay the ferry is<br>
receding, burdened with the<br>
load of those who want<br>
to reach the other side.<p>
