<h1>Blackberry / </em>Blackberry</em></h1>

The fescue lawn, iridescent, narrows and flows through a<br>
gap in the blackberry bush.  Borne by the verdant<br>
current, I begin the descent.<p>

<em>On the subject of loss, I have nothing to add.<br>
You, on the other hand (am I missing one hand?),<br>
had nothing but addition.</em><p>

A cluster of choughs caught in a bramble, tweeting,<br>
tweeting.  Querulous, garrulous, garroted: their ebon<br>
eyes swell to bursting.<p>

<em>Once, I played a tape of your reading.  Your voice,<br>
going down in hooks, hewed close to the lines and turns,<br>
insistent in its arrowed aim.</em><p>

Windmilling the half-filled basket, I forge ahead.<br>
Sea waves hiss and sigh through the shrub.  Burning<br>
sun-shafts leak through my tangled hair.<p>

<em>Words as elegy to what they signify&#8212;how I<br>
picked and sorted through yours, night and day,<br>
saying </em>blackberry, blackberry, blackberry.<p>

Now the lane has turned to sand.  A blue-red<br>
stigma in the ball of a barefootprint<br>
glows as if lit from below.<p>

<em>But I remember much more, your ink-stained<br>
thumb smearing a migrained temple, the wall<br>
crying out, the yeasty comfort of your apron.</em><p>

A sudden break in the hedge, and the sea is there.<br>
Pulled into a world of undivided light, my violent<br>
thirst for salt now extinguished.<p>

[Back in the kitchen, baking pans sit empty.<br>
The ceiling-fan cord casts a swinging shadow on an<br>
open book, its pages riffling in the breeze.]<p>
