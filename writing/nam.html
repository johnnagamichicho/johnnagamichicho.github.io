<h1>The Long Road to Venice</h1>

For almost a full minute neither of said anything.  The rather sudden
and spectacular failure of the engine (the bang-and-clatter, then the
furiously black smoke streaming up around the edges of the hood) had
momentarily mesmerized us as we pulled off to the side of the Italian
toll road, somewhere west of Brescia.  Then, as if on cue,
head-raising, belly-supported, mouth-wide-open laughter shot out of
both of our bodies and began to shake the still-warm carcass of the
BMW 2002.  This was just the latest in a series of disasters to
blindside us on this accidental trip, as if we were starring in a
slapstick road-buddy movie--but it was the most classic one yet.  And
by this time we were in a mood to ham it up for the audience:
&quot;You know I only paid DM 1000 for this piece of junk.  Screw
it.&quot; &quot;Yeah, let's get out of here.&quot; I take my backpack
off the back seat.  The obsolete registration papers are cleaned out
of the glove compartment, the key left in the ignition, and we were
off backpedaling on the shoulder with our right arms extended and
thumbs defiantly up.<p>

Nam brings calamity upon himself.  And he knows it.  I'm sure that the
death of the 2002 was caused by his failure to check the engine oil
level ever since he had bought it.  Whenever confronted with such
malfunctions of common sense, he would give me that grin, half
sheepish and half wicked, with that one eyebrow twitching
involuntarily as if to say: &quot;Sure I'm absent-minded.  But ENGINE
OIL is just not what life is all about.&quot; But what <em>is</em>
life all about then?  The answer evolved constantly.  For a while it
was physics, the noblest of the sciences, seeker of Truth.  Then
Sartre and Camus suddenly became popular.  The poetry of Wallace
Stevens.  Thomas Mann.  Then the cinema.  Goddard, Coppola, Kurosawa,
Bergman.  Making a quick million so he could pursue these higher
ideals became an obsession.  He began to invent things.  He started a
company based on a patent he filed for a new kind of electronic
compass.  Sadly, however, common sense and an ever-present mind are de
rigeur for success in business; Nam was powered out of his own company
by his two partners (who, in a perfect caricature of a bad soap opera,
fell in love with the same woman, fought over her, and in the meantime
dissipated the assets of the business).  Oh yes, and women.  They were
in and out of Nam's focus of mind: at times he could be uncomfortably
misogynistic; at other times he would be unbearably romantic.  In the
early years of our friendship, I was embroiled in an obsessive love
affair which made me oscillate so completely across the my emotional
spectrum that he would swing his attitude toward women in empathy with
whatever state I was in.<p>

The entrepreneurial stage lasted for a while.  I even got sucked into
helping from time to time; I can't deny that visions of an
independently wealthy lifestyle had allures for me, too.  During one
such venture we cranked out all-nighters during graduation week in the
basement machine shop of the physics department cutting, rolling, and
welding copper sheets.  Nam had visions of parlaying his honors
project into a breakthrough technology for magnetic resonance imaging
(then still called the politically incorrect nuclear magnetic
resonance imaging) by using a special type of resonant cavity rather
than the expensive and bulky electromagnetic coils.  At the time, the
medical imaging industry appeared to be a burgeoning juggernaut which
would rake in billions of dollars within a few years.  We would patent
the design and sell it to GE or Phillips for a not-to-be-sneezed-at
sum.  Unfortunately the design turned out to be fundamentally flawed
for such applications and we were left only with a shiny and
impeccable piece of copper sculpture and several nights worth of sleep
debt.<p>

Occasionally I would pick up the phone to hear a wired Nam on the
other end asking me for my opinion on a new idea.  Wireless
headphones.  LCDs for calculators to be sold in the Arab world (I
thought this was a joke: don't <em>we</em> use Arabic numerals?).
Heat recyclers for commercial clothes dryers.  Car phones programmed
to call the police if the vehicle was stolen.  Usually I would play
the skeptic--no, strike that &quot;play&quot;--I <em>was</em> a
skeptic.<p>

Once I put another friend into a compromising situation by telling Nam
that he (let's call him Bill) was not happy with his work and was
considering starting his own company.  Bill was the chief mechanical
engineer for an advanced electric car project, and this news sent Nam
into a frenzy of speculation and scheming.  After talking to Bill and
confirming his disgruntlement, he began negotiating with Hyundai
headquarters for a contract to develop an electric car which would be
the envy of the Japanese, Europeans, and Americans; in effect, he
promised them Bill.  By the time Bill and I found out, the agenda had
advanced to the point of a Hyundai executive planning a trip to the
U.S. to meet Nam and the renegade engineer.  Bill immediately had his
father, an L.A. lawyer, call Nam to advise him that it was in the best
interests of all involved to formally retract Bill's name from the
discussions with Hyundai.  Or else.  Nam was stunned.  He had no idea
that he had blundered into potential lawsuit territory.  He complied
with the polite yet transparently threatening request, and the
trans-Pacific venture folded like a dyslexic poker player who suddenly
realizes he's short of a straight by a card.<p>

Another time he was hiding from a lawyer for real--at <em>my</em>
house, of course.  He had rear-ended a car stopped at a red light in
Berkeley.  He was looking at his date and &quot;tickling her
chin.&quot; A guy walked out of the lawfully stopped car, they called
the police, exchanged addresses, and had their cars towed away.  A few
weeks later Nam received a letter from a lawyer informing him that the
client was suffering from a serious neck injury and that steps were
being taken to request a monetary compensation from the party at
fault.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Nam was born and raised in Seoul.  His parents were directors of
documentaries and dramas.  When he was young, his temper (and naivete)
would trap him into numerous fights; in response, he took up tae kwon
do and worked up to a black belt.  He grew up to be a barrel-chested
six-footer with none of the physical grace one expects from a martial
arts practitioner.  Also he kept his intelligence in the background,
preferring to keep an amiable but clueless persona up front.  The sum
effect was that of a friendly, bumbling strongman who had no clue as
to what was going on around him.  But he still had that temper.  Even
as an adult in America he would get into brawls in public places,
usually breaking his own glasses in the process, along with innocently
bystanding furniture.  He had an excess of energy which he had learned
to channel to a certain extent into the solution of thirty-page-long
quantum mechanics problem sets through nights thick with cigarette
smoke and eyes zoned with caffein, or into driving 800 miles on a
weekend trip to have lunch with an infatuation.  But his combination
of an easy trust in people and the quicksilver anger which
materialized upon betrayal would unexpectedly overwhelm him into
physical violence.<p>

His parents had divorced when he was in high school.  He was tender
toward his mother and his younger sister and brother.  But it was a
family which was refreshingly libertarian, especially for a Korean
one.  I was quite envious of Nam's relationship with his mother.  They
were not financially dependent on each other and related to each other
as friends.  In fact, I was quite attracted to his mother; even though
she had to work in a lawyer's office to support herself and her
younger children, she still carried the aura of an auteur and the
serene balance of mind which sometimes follows a long-needed divorce.
Nam and I joked about this, especially since he was infatuated with my
married sister.<p>

I never met Nam's father.  Whenever the father was mentioned, Nam's
voice would change--a slight tremolo would enter it, just like it did
before he was about to punch a suddenly hateful face.  For him, his
father = the lowest form of life.<p>

He also held a peculiar disdain for Korean-Americans who were too
mainstream (read &quot;white&quot;) American.  One time he whipped out
his lighter as we were walking around campus and starting setting fire
to campaign posters of an Austin Kim who was running for a seat on the
student council.  &quot;Fucking politician,&quot; he muttered.  I
never received any more explanation than that.<p>

Sometimes it seemed strange to me that he liked to hang out with me.
After all I was a half-breed who spoke Japanese but not Korean, who
had a white girlfriend, who was generally lazy and low on energy and
moral indignation.  Perhaps he was intrigued by my rootlessness and
lack of identity.  Sometimes he tried to get my Korean
&quot;instincts&quot; to surface and take over--attempts which were so
transparent that I had to laugh.  Why did I hang out with him?  Well,
let's just say that one was rarely bored in Nam's presence.<p>

During my two years in Africa, Nam and I did not keep in close touch.
Somehow, though, we both ended up in grad school at Cornell.  It was
not such a long time apart, but we had both changed substantially.
Nam Hoon (meaning &quot;honor to the South&quot;) Kim had consciously
returned to his roots.  He went back to Korea to, well, he said this
himself, look for a wife (and he did find one eventually).  He had
decided that life, after all, was about having a family (with
Confucian family values, no less).  He even started considering going
to law school (after all, a PhD in physics only provides for a
middling economic status), which was quite an irony considering his
past experience with lawyers.  I, on the other hand, had become even
more rootless and unfamilylike.  Even though living in the same town,
we drifted apart and lost contact.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

But now, back to the BMW.<p>

During the summer of '85 I wrote software in Moenchengladbach and Nam
smashed atoms at CERN.  One day he decided to visit me and hopped on a
train, lab notebook in hand.  He was working on some equations when,
coincidentally, another physicist sat down beside him and began asking
him about the equations.  So Nam gave him the notebook and received a
map in exchange.  They began talking after a while, then the stranger
left the train.  Nam then dozed off.  When he woke up he was in
Germany; the map was still on his lap.  I believe this sort of
departure from the normal minimum of attentive behavior could only
have happened with two physicists intent on discussing their work.<p>

Tragically, the lab notebook not only contained his precious
equations, but also his passport and my phone number (apparently the
border control never came around to wake him up).  When he arrived in
Moenchengladbach he went to the phone booth to call his roommate at
CERN, but realized he did not have any change.  He went to the kiosk,
but the vendor refused to simply make change.  Since he was starving
anyway, he bought a candy bar (a &quot;Hanuta&quot; bar, says Nam) to
obtain the necessary coins.<p>

He makes the call.  All incoming calls to CERN go through a central
switchboard operator who speaks French and who refuses to acknowledge
even the most rudimentary requests in English.  Nam does not know
French.  Result: the operator hangs up.<p>

Meanwhile Nam has eaten the Hanuta bar and goes back to the kiosk.  He
buys another and makes the call.  Same operator, same result.  Another
Hanuta bar scarfed in desperate hunger and anger.<p>

The process goes through one more cycle.  (&quot;I never want to look
at a FUCKING HANUTA BAR again.&quot; I don't know why he didn't buy
something else.  I guess he was somewhat panicked.)  The fourth time
around he yells immediately into the phone: &quot;I'M GOING TO KILL
YOU IF YOU DON'T CONNECT ME!&quot; Miraculously the operator suddenly
understood certain English phrases.<p>

In the end Nam always lucks out; otherwise, he would never have lived
to adulthood.  In this case, his roommate was home and was able to
find my phone number.  The other physicist had turned in the notebook
and passport at the train station, so Nam was able to get them back a
few days later.  Then he looked through the classifieds and bought a
car.  That was the summer when the dollar peaked against European
currencies, and everything seemed like a steal.  A used Beemer for
$300.  Nam, self-satisfied, drove it back to Geneva.<p>

At the end of the summer I traveled around Europe.  Inevitably I went
to Geneva, phoning Nam in advance to pick me up at the train station.
By this time I had known him long enough that I was unperturbed not to
find him upon my arrival.  I take a bus to CERN and have him paged by
the guard.  He comes out grinning, that one eyebrow twitching
uncontrollably: &quot;Jesus, I thought you said 'p.m.,' not
'a.m.'&quot; He immediately gets excited and wants to leave right
away; we had talked about driving to Venice.<p>

We get into his car to drive to the bank for money, but he realizes
that it is a Swiss holiday.  Meanwhile I had noticed that the car
still had the special oval license plate which is only for temporary,
border-crossing use.  Nam had--surprise!--neglected to register the
car in Switzerland.  But he gets this idea, which, somehow, didn't
seem so bad at the time: we could drive across the border into France
and come right back to see what would happen.<p>

Going into France was no problem--no papers checked, just a routine
wave-through.  But upon return, the Swiss border guard was
stereotypically meticulous.  First he asked for passports: I get my
U.S. passport back after a cursory glance; Nam's R.O.K. passport gets
a more careful examination.  And, sure enough, he spouts a few words
in French, finger jabbing at an open page: NAM'S VISA HAD EXPIRED.
After that he goes through the car papers and finds the expired
registration; not only that, the insurance had also expired.<p>

I don't remember exactly how we reacted.  Did I take Nam to task for
being a caricature of himself?  Did Nam threaten to kill the official
with a tae kwon do roundhouse kick to the head (for not speaking
English)?  Did passing border-crossers turn their heads to a barrage
of &quot;fuck&quot;s and &quot;shit&quot;s emanating from the little
red BMW?  I don't recall.  What I do remember clearly is Nam saying,
&quot;You know, I don't think Italy requires a visa for
Koreans.&quot;<p>

I remind you that we were on the way to the (closed) bank to get
money; therefore, Nam did not have (1) money, (2) a toothbrush, (3)
change of clothes, or any other items usually associated with
traveling.  But after consulting the map we decided Italy was close
enough that we had nothing to lose by trying to cross its border.<p>

This is what happened:<p>

i. The closest border crossing turns out to be a toll tunnel.  We have
neither the French francs nor the Italian lires required for passage.<p>

ii. We make a detour (a double detour after encountering a closed
road) through a remote mountain pass, and...success!  It is quite
late, and the border guards have gone home for the night.  The road
was beautifully illuminated by the light of the near-full moon
reflecting from the snow-covered mountainsides.<p>

iii. As soon as we emerge from the Alps, we unknowingly enter a toll
road.  There is a comically tense moment as we bribe the Italian toll
booth operator with Swiss francs.  Quickly we make our exit and pull
off to the side to get some sleep.<p>

iv. In the morning we find a bank, change money, and eat freshly fried
fish fillets, still sizzling with oil, for breakfast.  Thoroughly
rejuvenated in outlook, we head straight toward Venice.<p>

This brings us back to the beginning of this story.  After a few hours
of very pleasant driving, in fine northern Italian summer weather and
through a countryside which reminded us of California, the engine
seized, ceased, and desisted with a very loud noise and much smoke.<p>

We never found out what happened to the Beemer.  I imagine some
enterprising youngster butchered it and sold the prime cuts.<p>

After a long hour of sticking our thumbs out and looking conspicuously
foreign, we were finally picked up by three Napolianos in a tiny
Citroen.  Through much hand-waving we let it be known that we would
chip in for gas.  The five of us packed ourselves in and buzzed away
eastward.<p>

Okay, what next? you might ask.  I was in a similar mindset by this
time.  This is probably why when we stopped at a cafe and one of our
traveling companions motioned he had to go back to the car I
surreptitiously followed him.  In this case my paranoia was rewarded
with the sight of my backpack being rifled by our Napolitan friend.
His first response to our confrontation was ludicrous: he pulled out
his wallet and pointed at a portrait of the Virgin Mary, then clasped
at his heart as if to say that he was in the midst of committing an
act of extreme piety and Christian brotherliness.  But when it became
clear that Nam and I were departing immediately from their midst, all
three of them started cursing at us and even threw in a few choice
English phrases like &quot;motherfucker.&quot; Fortunately they did
not come after us.  Nam was more than ready to crack open a few eggs.
Although landing in an Italian jail for assault would have made for a
more dramatic twist to this story, there are limits to what seems
funny in a picaresque narrative if you have to live through it.<p>

In the parking lot we convince a milquetoast delivery van driver, who
is eating a sandwich, to give us a ride to the nearest train station.
He speaks a little English.  When we tell him of our hitchhiking
misadventure, he wags his index finger emphatically left-right,
left-right: &quot;In the south, beautiful land.  People, no good.
People, no good&quot;<p>

In Venice we find a place to stay, buy a large jug of cheap red wine,
and head over to the San Marco plaza to drink it.  The alcohol
amplifies the absurdity of the past two days.  We talk and laugh and
get plastered.  Nam thinks the overhead mercury vapor lamp is the
moon.  We decide to call it a night.<p>

<center><IMG src="Venice1.jpg" alt="Nam in Venice"><p>
Nam in Venice.<p>
</center>

But the hostel is on the other side of the city.  Navigating the maze
of alleys at night, first-time visitors, drunk, and without a map.
Then Nam gets sick; he wants to go to sleep on a bench.  But in a
surge of pigheadedness (and an overwhelming desire to reach a bed), I
convince him that I can lead us back.  We support each other in a
four-legged stagger and we are able to make it back without much
trouble.  We each go to our separate, though communal, rooms and go to
sleep.<p>

In the morning I see him with that grin of his and realize that
something had happened.  &quot;Oh nothing much.  When I came in last
night I just flopped on the nearest bed and there was a girl already
there.  She didn't scream or anything but it was kinda
embarrassing.&quot; The next night we were in the same room.  In the
middle of the night, Nam's bed abruptly broke and he landed on the
floor.  &quot;Now THAT wasn't my fault.&quot;<p>

As I said, however, Nam gets lucky in the end.  On our return to
Switzerland, Nam's passport was only casually examined, and we made it
to Geneva just in time to catch the last bus to CERN.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

I hear Nam married a nice Korean girl.  I can't help but wonder
whether his born-again traditionalism and Confucian family values will
straitjacket his clueless and once-boundless energy.  But somehow I
suspect that one day I will see a familiar face in a newswire photo
under the caption, &quot;PARENT STARTS BRAWL AT PTA MEETING.&quot;<p>
