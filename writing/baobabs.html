<h1>Remembering Baobabs</h1>

Baobabs are melancholy.  I don't mean that in an anthropomorphic
sense; I mean that when standing in a savannah that is dotted with
nothing but baobabs in every horizontal direction, I invariably feel
melancholy.  And when I <em>remember</em> standing in a savannah that
is dotted with nothing but baobabs in every horizontal direction, I
feel even more melancholy.<p>

Is melancholy a state peculiarly associated with baobabs?  My oldest
sister was a piano major.  When I was three years old, she practiced
on the Yamaha grand for several hours a day.  She played mostly
Chopin.  I listened carefully every day and pointed out to her
whenever she made a mistake.  She was incredulous.  "How could you
tell it was a mistake?  You're only three!"  I don't know how; it just
didn't sound right.  I asked her to play the <em>Fantasie
Impromptu</em> again.  I particularly liked the middle section because
the key had many flats; that meant that the flow of notes would have a
darker, unrequited feel to it, a quality that I would now call
melancholy.  This is all bunkum, of course.  My sister played a modern
piano with equal-tempered tuning.  The intervals between notes, and
thus the "flavor" of the harmony, should not have been dependent on
the key.  And yet the memory remains; and to this day I prefer to play
in flats rather than in sharps.<p>

But what about the baobabs?  The Little Prince's home planet was a
small chunk of rock around which a few baobabs interweaved their
tentacular roots.  I used to wonder how such a small planet could have
such huge trees growing on them--wouldn't the branches poke out
through the atmosphere into space?  As a scientist studying the
Earth's atmosphere, I can now confirm that this was a very good
question.  But returning to the point I was supposed to make in this
paragraph: Was not the story of the Little Prince, indeed,
melancholy?<p>

I'm trying harder to recall.  I think I lied earlier.  The savannah in
which I stand has more than baobabs.  There is, for example, the
baobab fruit.  Or at least what I remember as the baobab fruit.
Something white and chalky, with large seeds.  I suck on the seeds to
dissolve the flavor in my mouth.  It is faintly sour and sweet, like
the echoes of sour tarts that I used to buy at the corner
five-and-dime.<p>

I look closer.  The fruit is being sold by an old woman.  She is
sitting in the sparse shade cast by the tree, her dark, cracked feet
lying alongside a rippling root.  She is also selling small plastic
bags of a red liquid.  I pick one up and look at the speckless sky
through this ruby filter.  The woman smiles toothlessly.  I nibble a
hole in a corner of the bag and let the juice trickle down my throat.
Along with its taste and fragrance comes the name: <em>bissap</em>.  A
sweetened drink made from hibiscus flowers.  I realize that is exactly
what I wanted.<p>

But it's really at night that the melancholy sets in.  A moonless
night.  As the pupils expand I begin to see the bifurcating baobab
branches as a silhouette against the Milky Way.  There appears to be a
foot path that meanders its way between the strangely regular spacing
of the trees, so I shuffle along it.  I take pleasure in the cool sand
sneaking into my sneakers, the silky sound and sensation.<p>

But this recollection, or the simulation of a memory, is slippery.
What was I wearing?  And carrying?  Surely I must have had some
luggage.  Was there hunger?  Weariness?  A general sense of loss as if
time, like the stars, were simultaneously too slow and too fast?<p>

Contrary to what you might have concluded, baobabs are not always
melancholy.  For example, baobabs viewed from inside the glassed-in,
air-conditioned carriage of a first-class train are simply sad.  And,
you must agree, sad is not at all the same as melancholy.  Besides,
these baobabs are moving very rapidly (in <em>our</em> reference
frame), and can hardly be considered to be in the same class as the
trees that we looked upon while standing in the savannah--there is at
least a 40-mph difference.<p>

Perhaps we have stumbled unto something here.  Is slowness related to
melancholy?  After all, the middle movement of the <em>Fantasie
Impromptu</em> that I thought so melancholy was also the slow
movement.  And one doesn't look at a girl who is running and think,
"That runner sure is melancholy."  Or, in a more accurate analogy to
the baobabs, "Watching that runner sure makes me feel melancholy."
However, watching a man sitting on a park bench watching the runner
scoot by just might trigger that melancholy feeling.<p>

We are faced with a choice.  Beyond the plain of baobabs is a river.
A gently arching bridge reaches across the river and on the other side
is a city.  The pale pastels of the buildings glow in the harsh
sunlight.  On the other hand, there is the ill-defined foot path among
the baobabs in the still night.  Perhaps it is my imagination, but I
think I hear voices ahead.<p>

The choice is yours.  Hm?  You want me to cross the river?  So be
it.<p>

A diesel station wagon rumbles past as I walk across the bridge.  It
turns out that the city is not on the other shore but on an island in
the river.  It is elongated parallel to the flow like an enormous
barge that sprouted colonial buildings.  As I rest standing curbside
at the central <em>place</em>, a church bell begins to ring.  The
irregular overtones set a nearby window pane to buzzing. I look north
and south along the straightaway; I see not a single person.<p>

It is a thin island--only five or six blocks at its widest.  A simple
composition--the river, the buildings, the sky . . . and no people--it
would make a fine watercolor.  But that can't be quite right.  Because
the next scene is me sitting down at a dark little <em>tieb</em> shop
eating lunch.  And I must have asked some people where I could buy a
meal, because there were no signs announcing "I am a <em>tieb</em>
shop; come inside and have a bite to eat."<p>

But if there were a sign, it would have been wrong.  Today's lunch was
not <em>ti&eacute;boudienne</em> but <em>maf&eacute;</em>, a peanut
stew.  I didn't complain.  I was enjoying the play of light and shadow
in the rectangular, glassless window that opened onto the east side of
the river.<p>

By now you would have the idea that this was a sparse and silent city.
That would be the correct impression.  But I have withheld one
important sensory element that I will now disclose as if nonchalantly
waving a new semaphore: <em>The smell of the sea</em>.  The far shore
of the river is little more than a sandbar a hundred yards wide that
segregates the oscillation of the oceanic waves and tides from the
irreversibly linear flow of the river.  Standing at its crest I can
view the two worlds and be of two minds at once.  Looking northward
along the coast I can see the edge of the sand dunes, the southernmost
edge of the great desert.  That must be where the river veers inland
and takes on itself the responsibility of a national boundary.  The
golden dunes flutter and wink in the afternoon convection.<p>

I did not walk along the beach to those sand dunes that afternoon, nor
on any other afternoon.  Those sand dunes were never reached.  I never
walked amongst them, reaching down to sift my fingers through the hot
granules, letting my gaze run along the parallel ripples casting
frozen shadow waves across the rolling surface.  Never.<p>

Now I'm starting to get the uneasy feeling that I was wrong all along.
Perhaps the baobabs are not the source of melancholy at all.  Think
about it: A four-lane boulevard lined with baobabs.  Baobabs in
Central Park.  A baobab Christmas tree.  A bonsai baobab.  I don't
feel melancholy at all.  Do you?<p>

Cut back to the plain of baobabs.<p>

I'm not wearing socks, and I can wiggle my toes in the cool sand that
pours in and out through the holes in my running shoes.  The
persistent, dusty harmattan winds of the daytime have died with the
setting sun, and now the air is motionless, clear.  The stars wheeling
slowly about, no distant glow of city lights to whiten the horizon.<p>

Then I hear voices.  Vectoring my eyes toward the sound I slowly begin
to see the outline of a small compound.  I imagine that I can see the
steady light from a kerosene lantern leaking through the slats of a
hut.<p>

Here's what you see next: I'm standing inside the compound greeting a
semicircle of seated men with one of only a handful of Wolof phrases
that I know.  The men appear either dumbfounded or entirely
indifferent depending upon your own expectations.  You may wonder what
I'm doing there.  Perhaps they do also.  It may be that even I am
wondering why I'm there.  Besides, who am I?<p>

"I am Abdou Diouf," I say.<p>

Split-second silence.  Then a tremendous burst of laughter, a general
round of good humor.<p>

I am offered the corrugated-tin shack of the very tall man in the
white <em>boubou</em> for lodging.  He, who is apparently the chief of
the compound, will sleep in the bed of one of his wives.<p>

You see, this is a useful trick.  When in doubt, introduce yourself as
the President of the country and you are bound to be treated with
great hospitality.<p>

Next morning I wake up to find a camel caravan outside the compound.
Are camels melancholy?  Yes, but with a certain levity.  I bet Erik
Satie liked camels.  Now I'm trying to recall whether they are
one-humped or two-humped.  I rub the sleep from my eyes, but it's
hard to tell.  For simplicity, I will remember them as one-humped
(less memory allocation, you know).<p>

Many questions cross my mind as the caravan prepares to depart.  For
example: When you run out of water can you poke a straw into the hump
and drink?  Do nomads pay taxes?  Do camels see mirages?  Is it all
right with Allah if you pray to Mecca while riding a camel?  Do camel
drivers think baobabs are melancholy?<p>

When I grow up, I want to be a camel driver.<p>

Days go by.  In the morning I help the women shell peanuts.  In the
afternoon I drink tea with the men.  Three rounds are brewed with the
same leaves, which means that the tea gets weaker each time; however,
more sugar is put in so it becomes progressively sweeter.  But the
real key is to pour the tea from above your head, so that each
glassful develops a healthy head of foam.  The arm movement of the
veteran tea maker is smooth and precise, like the windup motion of a
fastball pitcher.  In the evening I eat supper with the chief,
squatting on the prayer mat, dipping my right-hand fingers into the
shared plate of <em>rago&ucirc;t</em> and millet.<p>

Eventually I will have to leave, and I do.<p>

South of the baobab plains is a railroad track running east-west.  If
you follow it westward, you will arrive at the big city with the
rectangular-gridded streets, clever pickpockets, and stalls selling
bootleg cassettes.  Follow the coastline south and you will see a
village on a small island just off the beach.  If you walk across the
wood-planked bridge, you will find its streets and buildings to be
made of sea shells.  And, along with the unexpected sight of white
crosses in a graveyard, you will notice a smell that you've not
encountered in a long time--the robust aroma of roasting pork.  If you
then wander inland, you will cross salt flats and arrive at a town
with a name that sounds like "cowlick."  There the well water will be
so salty that clothes will stick to your skin after bathing.<p>

In the end, you will come to another river.  But this time there will
be no bridge, you will have to commit yourself to a ferry, there will
be palm trees and a lush green on the other side, and it will be
another country, another arbitrary colonial boundary, and I will buy
my last plastic bag of <em>bissap</em> for the crossing, letting it
dribble, blood-red, into my mouth like an IV drip, taking nourishment
from the moment, from the images that will take root in the crevices
of my brain, images that will grow and branch out to become
inextricably tangled with the play of midnight sun on a patch of
cloudberries, mist dispersing to reveal volcanic lakes with the colors
of jade, sapphire, and black gold, a lioness yawning after her morning
drink, whipless scorpions scuttling across a river cave wall, the
comfort of pea soup and pancakes on Thursdays, and the windy gap in
the hills where we used to lie in the tall grass, thinking that was
our whole world, the sun, the wind, the smell of grass, you, and I.<p>
