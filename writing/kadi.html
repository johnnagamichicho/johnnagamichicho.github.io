<h1>Kadi and the Dog</h1>

A mangy mutt scrounges in front of my verandah for bits of anything
edible, maybe a dead lizard or millipede.  He's got tough competition
from the neighbor's goat and chickens: the birds operating on the
microscale and the omnivorous goats cleaning up like a vacuum cleaner.
I can clearly see his ribs through the worm-bitten, laterite-dusted
hide, the relentless African sun beating, beating down on his back.
Why doesn't he go rest in a shade somewhere like all of us sensible
creatures?  Across the way I can see Pa Koroma sitting under the zinc
pan on his porch with his afternoon gourd of palm wine.  He notices me
watching him and he waves: <em>Eh, Mistah Mahk, aw di go de go?</em> I
answer, <em>A tel God tenki, Pa.</em> Pa: <em>Kam!  Tide, di poyo
sweet pas mak!  Le wi drink am!</em> He holds up the gourd.  I shall
accept the invitation.<p>

Two things happened while I was sharing the frothy <em>poyo</em> with
Pa Koroma (he was right--it really was sweet today).  First, a little
girl of perhaps three tottered over to us, dressed only with a tiny
gold-colored earring in her right ear, pointed at me, and said,
<em>Pisko!</em>, that is, Peace Corps.  This happened all the time in
the beginning, but by now I expected everyone in the village to call
me by my name.  So I asked her what her name was and I told her mine.
I feel embarrassed now to admit that I was irritated by that incident
(she's so young, after all); I guess anything that threatens my notion
that I have been accepted into this community is upsetting.  This is
absurd, of course: I am and never will be even close to becoming a
Temne.  I may learn their language, their culture, the way they eat
<em>fufu</em>, the art of tie-dyeing <em>gara</em>, even the rituals
of the secret society, but my memories, the mythology of the self,
will never be Temne.  But enough of that.  The other thing that
happened was that the stupid dog was nearly run over by Alhaji
Bangura's blue Mazda lorry ("TO BE A MAN IS NOT EASY"), which came
teetering around the bend, the usual cargo of about thirty market
women coming back from town and the daily-special load on top (looked
like sacks of Chinese black market rice along with a couple of
tied-down goats), emitting a painful, explosive noise with every rut
as if it were going over a field of boulders.  The dog staring
straight into the nose of the onrushing vehicle (Alhaji only slows
down for goats and children), the hoarse horn sounding two staccato
<em>gbip</em>s, the dog still lying prone on the dry clay, staring,
then a blue roar, a red storm of dust, settling, settling, the dog now
panting, eyes still staring straight down the road.<p>

I've brought my stool over to the side of my house where Kadiatu is
pounding cassava leaves.  Her lean, powerful arms drive the pestle up
and down, the cassava releasing that sharp, minty odor, up and down,
her knees bending slightly inside her threadbare lappa, her tired
breasts drooped and trembling.  Kadi is thirty, a mother seven times
over, a mother in mourning seven times over.  It was only last week
that her latest child, Brima, died.  The illness manifested itself
three weeks ago when the mild temperature and coughing that he was
suffering from suddenly escalated to severe vomiting and a 40-deg C
fever.  At that point Kadi came to beg me for some aspirin which I
grudgingly doled out thinking that she was using Brima as an excuse
for her usual headaches.  By the time she came again to fetch me, fear
was swimming in her eyes, her Temne words pitched high as
<em>kora</em> strings.<p>

Inside Kadi's house I found Brima wrapped in country cloth, lying
sideways on the prayer mat, his neck bent way back as if he were
trying to look out the window--the classic meningitis symptom.  He was
still conscious, but he would not respond to my words.  I immediately
prepared to take Kadi and Brima to the hospital in Makeni, a four-hour
trip on my motorbike.<p>

Kadi has stopped the pounding to say something to me.  She says she
has found a wife for me.  Every week she finds me a new wife, usually
a girl of thirteen or fourteen, newly initiated into Kadi's secret
society.  I tell her I have a "wife" <em>na America</em>, but she
doesn't buy that at all.  <em>Sontehm yu fo get Temne uman we yu de
deh na Temne lan</em>.  You should have a Temne wife while you live in
Temne country.<p>

The doctor in Makeni told me right away that Brima's chances were
slim.  Soon after the first injections of ampicillin he slipped into a
coma.  When I told Kadi that the doctor could not help Brima, she
insisted quietly but with absolute conviction that she had to take him
back to the village to see the witch doctor.  The next day I drove
them back.<p>

Kadi and Brima were in the bush for three whole days.  I never asked
her what the witch doctor did to Brima, but when they came back from
the bush Brima was definitely at the brink.  After two more days I
heard the piercing, rhythmic wail of ritual mourning emanating from
the house next door.<p>

Kadi has now built a three-stone fire; she places a sooty pot on top
and pours in palm oil from a Pepsi bottle.  Next she throws in pounded
peppers and onions.  That filthy mutt has stealthily crept closer to
the handful of smoked river fish that Kadi is about to throw into the
pot.  Kadi and the dog are looking at each other.  She quickly grabs
the fish and deposits them into the bubbling oil.  The dog looks at
her for a moment, then lies down on the ground, staring at the
steaming pot.<p>

The sun is low in the sky.  To the north, the horizon is a soupy
yellow like good old L.A. smog--the harmattan must be starting to blow
from the Sahara.  Soon I will get my brief respite from the
interminable humidity.  And everyone else will complain to me about
how their skin is cracking from the dryness.<p>
