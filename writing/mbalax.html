Nine years ago, when I was teaching at Fourah Bay College in Sierra
Leone, I decided to spend my Christmas vacation exploring another West
African country.  For no particular reason I chose Senegal, which was
a couple of short flights north on the Ghana Airways coastal hopper.
After having purchased the ticket and having obtained a visa at the
Senegalese consulate (which was cleverly disguised as a small tailor
shop located on an improbable back street in Freetown), I checked out
my modest cache of U.S. dollars from the Peace Corps office.  The only
difficulty I experienced on the journey was getting to the airport,
with the half-hour ride across the bay turning into a three-hour drive
around because of a broken ferry boat.
<P>
Senegal was an eye-opener for someone just arriving from Sierra Leone.
For one thing, I had assumed that other West African countries would
have dismal public transportation as in Sierra Leone.  I was
pleasantly surprised.  In Senegal one could travel in relative comfort
in a seven-seat Peugeot 504, the top-tier intercity vehicle.  The
prices were fixed and the car could not be overloaded.  No need to
wonder what today's price would be or to squeeze into the nonexistent
space between the driver and his door.  The dry, flat savannah dotted
with baobab trees was also a stark contrast to the near-rain forest
and rugged terrain of the Freetown peninsula.  The people, on the
other hand, were generally taller, wore more traditional style
clothing (the body-length embroidered gowns known as <EM>boubous</EM>),
spoke French and Wolof, and were mostly Muslims.  What caught me
completely off guard, though, was the distinctly different flavor of
the pop music.  It immediately enchanted me then, and even now when
someone asks me, ``Which country produces your favorite pop music?'' I
answer, ``Senegal.''
<P>
There is an identifiable pan-African pop sound that resulted from the
Congolese <EM>rumba</EM> boom of the 60s, which itself was seeded by the
preceding worldwide craze in Cuban music.  Congolese innovators such
as the Grand Kalle and Franco perfected the cool and sweet aesthetics
that underlie the trademark circular, arpeggio guitar riffs and
major-third vocal harmonies.  The style became dominant in much of
sub-Saharan Africa, and remains extremely popular to this day, often
overshadowing local developments in small countries like Sierra Leone
that had lost their own recording industry and prominent musicians due
to the deteriorating economy.
<P>
Cuban pop music also took root in Senegal, but the hybrid that
sprouted on its hardscrabble Sahelian soil was a far cry from the
mellow euphonies of the Congo.  The melodramatic ``Latin'' chord
progressions and edgy brass interjections survived, while the
melismatic upper-register vocals of Islamic muezzins with the
accompanying Arabic modalities were introduced, resulting in a fresh
harmonic mix.  The richness of traditional Wolof percussion patterns
were woven in with <EM>sabars</EM> (large bass drums), <EM>djembes</EM>
(carved hand drums with goatskin heads) and <EM>tamas</EM> (double-headed
hourglass-shaped drums that are made to ``talk'' by squeezing them
under one's armpit) played alongside the Western drum kit.  The
rapid-fire dialog between the singer and the <EM>tama</EM> player is
often the climax of a song.  The resulting sound came to be known as
<EM>mbalax</EM>, and its underpinning aesthetics are hot, fast, and
complex.  <EM>Mbalax</EM> also spawned its own high-stepping, high-energy
dance called the <EM>ventilateur</EM>, which raised a ruckus among the
pious because of the provocative manner in which the women hiked their
<EM>boubous</EM> and flashed their forbidden legs.
<P>
Indisputably the seminal <EM>mbalax</EM> band was &#201;toile de Dakar.
And Youssou N'Dour, who became its lead singer as a mere teenager, has
nurtured the evolution of <EM>mbalax</EM> into an internationally
recognized style.  At the time of my visit to Senegal, he was emerging
as the hottest star in the country and was looking toward a wider
horizon through collaborations with Peter Gabriel.  Since then he has
used his clout and money to open his own recording studio and label in
Dakar to promote other local musicians, an admirable attitude in a
time when most famous African popsters opt to live the high life in
Paris or London.  Fortunately, Senegal has an unusually robust
internal market that buys its own music rather than imported <EM>
soukous</EM> or <EM>zouk</EM> or reggae.  The vitality of the local music
scene can be seen and heard while walking around the market in any
city, with tiny cassette stalls crammed full of the latest releases
and bootleg recordings, the boom box blasting out the current hits.
Everyone has his or her favorite band, and amiable arguments can break
out over a glass of <EM>caf&#233; au lait</EM> about the relative merits
of each one.
<P>
Although Youssou N'Dour has been generally acknowledged to be the top
dog for some time, other musicians have emerged with their own take on
the Senegalese sound.  Baaba Maal purveys a more diversified style
with recent forays into hiphop and orchestral arrangements to go along
with his sophisticated, socially conscious lyrics.  His bluesy
acoustic duets with the blind guitarist, Mansour Seck, show his rootsy
side, while performances with his electric band, Dande Lenol, draw
large, dance-minded audiences.  Ismael L&#244;, who is also a painter,
is more introspective, and there are traces of the Western folk
revival in his songs.  The band of the moment for the urban youth of
Dakar differs from month to month (Xalam was the choice at the time of
my visit), but the various incarnations of Super Diamono, with their
stripped down <EM>rock-mbalax</EM> (and attitude to boot), have stood the
test of time.  For relative old-timers there is Tour&#233; Kunda, a
reggae-heavy group that predates the rise of <EM>mbalax</EM>.
<P>
These days you can see Youssou N'Dour or Baaba Maal play in cities
like Boston or Denver or Seattle.  But beware that they play different
sets on their overseas gigs from the ones at home.  The same is true
on their albums: the domestic-only cassette releases contain songs not
available on Western CDs that are thought to only appeal to the
locals.  So nothing beats being there for the real thing.  You're
standing barefoot on the beach at Mbour with a bottle of Gazelle beer
in hand, the band members are wandering on stage one by one, the crowd
is jockeying for the prime spots, and the guy next to you is hoisting
up a tape machine on his shoulder preparing to make a bootleg
recording.  The PA system squeals with feedback as the MC introduces
the band.  The opening wave of sound from the stage is met by the roar
of audience approval.  Adrenaline charges the expressions on
everyone's face.  You look up at the clear night sky and thank the
stars that you decided to come to Senegal.<BR>
