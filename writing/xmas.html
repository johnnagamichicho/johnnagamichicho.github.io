<h1>Christmas Island, 1999</h1>

<h2>Wed, Mar 10</h2>

4:30 AM check in at Honolulu's Aloha Air charter flight counter.
There is a small crowd of excited, middle-aged white men in baseball
caps with six-foot long tubes.  Phrases like "the Super Bowl of bone
fishing" float by.  Still, when we board, the 737 is barely half full
for the three-hour flight.  The once-a-week charter runs at
a loss and is subsidized by the government of Kiribati (even though
the round-trip fare is $750).<p>

The 6:00 AM take-off affords a sunrise view.  First, cirrus clouds
illuminated an iridescent salmon-pink from below, then a quick,
tropical ascent of the sun's disk.  Some mild turbulence along the way
causing a couple of no-smoking/fasten seat belt signs in the front
rows to flicker--sign of a loose electrical connection, but, we
hope, not of a general lack of maintenance.<p>

When it comes into view, I see that Christmas Island stretches out
farther than I thought it would.  It curls around a milky lagoon, with
a stout tail pointing east-south-east, bristling with coconut palms
and shrub.  The cracked and patched landing strip paved with crushed
coral is just long enough for the 737, and the plane has to make a U
turn at the end of the runway to taxi back toward the terminal.  Two
small adjacent buildings with zinc pan roofs hold the "lobby,"
immigration control, health inspection, and customs for this only
regularly scheduled flight.  The bone fishing enthusiasts are herded
onto vans by the welcoming local guides (one sports a T-shirt that
declares "No Viagra on Christmas Island / You always get a bone"),
while the eight of us on a NASA mission wait for the five rented
pickup trucks.  Our man on the island is John Bryden, a thirty-year
resident from Scotland, now a naturalized citizen of Kiribati, who
operates a multifaceted business (JMB Enterprises), and who seems to
be <em>the</em> local business contact for foreigners.<p>

One drives on the left side on Kiritimati (the local spelling for
Christmas), but the cars have steering wheels on the left, a rather
confusing situation that seems to happen on small islands that have
been under the influence of both the U.S. and the U.K. (as in the
Virgin Islands).  "The fuel gage doesn't work, so just fill up the
tank when you reach 200 miles," advises Bryden.  We convoy to the
Captain Cook Hotel, through the town of Banana ("Population 957" reads
the sign), carefully slowing down to avoid hitting small children
playing ("Farewell Banana" reads the exit sign).  The hotel is a
cinder-block and zinc-pan affair, the sort of place that one would pay
about $10 per night for in most developing countries.  There's a sign
over the front office that reads "Licensed to retail fermented and
spirituous liquor."  Because of the bone fishermen, some of us are
obliged to share rooms, and, unfortunately, I happen to be assigned
with a guy who is suffering from the flu as well as a chronic tendency
to snore like an SST breaking Mach 1.<p>

Since I have the keys to one of the trucks, I decide to do some
first-day exploring.  I drive the one main road counterclockwise to
the northwest tip, i.e., the upper jaw around the big central lagoon.
The island is crisscrossed with paved and unpaved roads that have salt
bush encroaching on them from both sides.  So many roads and little
traffic, like an abandoned military base.  All the rusting containers
and machinery scattered randomly in the landscape lend a
post-apocalyptic feel to the place.  Crabs leisurely wait until the
vehicle approaches close before completing their crossing.  Christmas
Island did host a number of offshore Cold War nuclear bomb tests.  The
first of the current residents arrived only in the late '50s.  It
became independent from Britain when the Republic of Kiribati was
formed in 1979.  Such a short history of human residency can be
discerned in the temporary nature of many of the buildings--trailers,
block houses--even the traditional thatched-roof huts of the
Gilbertese blend in with the prefab metal boxes to form the <em>mise en
scene</em> of a frontier land.  No wonder Captain Cook, when he first
landed on this uninhabited atoll (the world's largest) on Christmas
Eve 1777, decided it was not worth exploiting.<p>

There are seaweed farms in the milky-jade lagoon.  There are many
birds in the lagoon.  Frigate birds with wing spans of six feet hover
in the stiff trade wind.  One descended to within two feet of my head,
surprising me with its sudden shadow.  It floated magically there for
several seconds, like a tethered kite; it must have been riding the
airflow forced upward by my body.  On the ocean side of the spit,
there are fishing vessels anchored offshore, and I meet several young
Chinese sailors who had come ashore to buy some necessary supplies:
cartons of Marlboro, chewing gum, candy.  We cannot communicate much,
because they do not speak English.  But one manages to make a joke
about me taking him to America.<p>

<h2>Thu, Mar 11</h2>

Plump local lobster tails for dinner last night.  Today we had some
trevally sashimi (complete with soy sauce and wasabi) courtesy of the
fishermen.  Not bad for "summer camp."<p>

After work I spend the late afternoon swimming in the lagoon, where it
is protected from the strong easterlies.  On the way to the lagoon is
a graveyard of British military equipment, rusting heaps of what used
to be tanks, trucks, portable buildings, pipes.  Again, roads
crisscross every which way, with not another vehicle nor person in
sight.<p>

Out on the lagoon seabirds are everywhere.  The water is rather murky
from the silted bottom; vague shadows of fish dart by.  Just out of
the water there are holes all over the coral sand with crabs flitting
in and out of them.  The water must be around 80 degs.  It's a very
comfortable swim.<p>

After dinner there is a traditional music and dance show.  Before it
begins, we each receive a flower wreath on our heads.  There are nine
drummers, all male.  Eight of them sit around a hollow wooden box
(about 5' x 5' and 6" thick) and beat on it in sync with their bare
hands.  The box has vent holes on the sides.  One of the drummers
(white-haired and portly with age) has a police whistle, which is used
to signal beginnings and changes; he is obviously the leader and he
also calls out the starting lines.  The ninth drummer is an old man
who beats dotted eighth and triplet rhythms like a military snare drum
with wooden sticks on a large aluminum biscuit tin.  He plays the
rapid, interior rhythm, while the eight play a heavy duple downbeat.<p>

In the back are about thirty dancers--men, women, and children.  They
wear grass skirts--males with bare tops, females with white
blouses. The drummers wear a purple cloth wrap around their waists.
Everyone wears a flower wreath on their heads and a leaf sash over one
shoulder.  The general pattern goes like this: The leader blows his
whistle, calls out a line.  The dancers sing, mostly in unison, but
also in harmony that tend toward open diatonic chords, with melodies
that have lots of perfect fourth and fifth intervals.  The tempo
begins slowly, then accelerates as the drummers also crank up the
volume toward an abrupt finish.  The dancers make swinging and swaying
arm movements as they sing, mimicking the motions of the activity they
are singing about, such as sailing, fishing, tree climbing; the songs
are about every day activities.  Each song hardly ever lasts more than
a minute.  After a group of songs, the dancers rotate so that a new
subgroup stands in the front row.  It's quite an energetic show.  I
ask Polau, the hotel manager, about the group, and he tells me that
they are all originally from a western Kiribati island called Nikunau
near the equator (hence the name of the group, Aan Nikunau).  Most of
them were brought to Christmas in the '60s to work on copra (coconut
meat) plantations.<p>

I ask Polau about the hotel.  It was originally British officers'
quarters, which was converted by NASDA (the Japanese counterpart to
NASA) into a hotel when they were constructing their satellite
tracking station (this explains the shelf full of Japanese books in
the dining room, with titles like "English That will be in Exams,"
"Six Pieces of Tonkatsu (Fried Pork Cutlets)," and "Hemorrhoids can be
Cured as Easily as This!").  Now it is owned by the government and
caters mainly to bone fishermen and to the occasional scientific
campaign.  The pine-tree-lined driveway (typical of an English estate)
and a stone marker listing the squadrons that constructed it attest to
its colonial lineage.<p>

<h2>Fri, Mar 12</h2>

After a morning of work, I go on an excursion in search of a swimmable
beach with five other people.  (The hotel beach is too rocky and the
surf too high.)  It rains intermittently, but never more than about
fifteen minutes at a time.  There is no severe weather this close to
the equator--not enough Coriolis force to spin things up.  One of the
five is a weatherbeaten world sailor, Jerry, who used to be a
biologist.  He's on his way from Central America to Samoa and has been
waiting out the southern hemispheric hurricane season for the last
four months on Christmas Island.  He subsists by performing odd jobs
such as repairing the hotel's water system and advising the government
on ecological matters.  He's full of stories from his past travels and
about wildlife.  He's also a good source of information about
Christmas Island.  One can always expect to find an idiosyncratic lone
traveler like him in these out of the way places.<p>

Some things I learn from Jerry: Garbage on the island is simply piled
up in a dump area; most people don't have flush toilets--they simply
go in the lagoon.  The lagoons that look like they are filled with red
clay are really algae blooms.  Christmas Island is not a typical atoll
in that it has so much land mass (the "tail" part) and not just a thin
ring.  There are poisonous sea snakes ("yellow bellies") here; one was
spotted by a child near the hotel yesterday.  The delicate lavender
shells we find on the beach had floated across the ocean on rafts of
self-blown air bubbles.<p>

We stop at a long stretch of beach with coarse coral sand.  We are
still on the windward side, so the surf is rough and under the water
is mostly rock.  So much for swimming.  But the water is very clear,
and some sea life can be seen in the shallows.  Lifting a rock, I
spook an eel about three feet long.  Tiny glow-blue fish dart by.<p>

I learn from the others that the Chinese sailors that I met on the
beach two days ago had been arrested for coming on shore without a
passport or visa.  I recall how they seemed reluctant to return to the
ship.  Did they go AWOL on purpose?  Why would they pick Christmas
Island?  Perhaps they thought that it would be easy to bribe their way
out (although they did not seem to have much money).  Without economic
"lubrication" Third World bureaucracies can be very tough.  Apparently
the Christmas Island government guards their waters jealously for
fishing rights.  I had read an article about a Korean fisherman
getting shot for illegally entering their fishing waters.<p>

On the way back to the hotel we stop to get some coconuts.  Nobody
wants to climb, so we try various other methods: poking with a downed
branch, tossing old coconuts like a football at the hanging ones, and
shaking the tip of a drooping frond.  We manage to get a few down and
Jerry chops them open with a pocket knife.  The ones we get are fairly
ripe already--the meat is firm and the juice is slightly fizzy.<p>

After dinner there is another local musical group: the Banana Village
Singers.  Polau says they are of mixed origin.  They sing religious
and love songs.  There are fifteen singers, two with guitars, one with
ukulele, only one woman.  The progression is solidly I-IV-V(-V7) with
a single tempo for all the songs.  There are some call-and-response
passages, mostly unison with some thirds and fifths thrown in.  It's a
shouting, vibratoless, singing style.  They are clad in uniformed
T-shirts and printed cloth wraps that have the map of Christmas Island
on them.  Cloth petal wreaths adorn their heads.  Movements are
limited to hand clapping.  They close with an a capella welcome song
in English.  A bone fisher, feeling toasty on wine, pounds the table
appreciatively in rhythm.<p>

<h2>Sun, Mar 14</h2>

More rain yesterday.  After working for most of the day I walked
around the vicinity of the hotel.  The garbage strewn about everywhere
is depressing.  Such a short history of human habitation and look how
much we've altered it.  It's not only the heavy equipment left by the
British and U.S. military to rust--there are also piles of beer cans,
appliances, car parts, fishing line, etc. that the current residents
must have scattered.  The organic stuff gets scavenged right away by
the ubiquitous crabs, but the rest just remain.  Is it the feeling of
being a temporary settler that makes it all right to dirty your
neighborhood?  The idea that there are too few people here to affect
the island?  Just following the example set by the imperialists?  The
population is apparently growing pretty fast.  All the literature that
I've read say population 2000, but the current estimate is closer to
4000.  There sure are a lot of young children in the villages.  I
wonder if there is a planned parenthood type of program?<p>

The hotel food has been quite luxurious.  There's the daily sashimi
with the catch of the day, and for dinner there is usually at least
three different kinds of protein.  Last night was whole roast pig
(very tender), two kinds of octopus (barbecue and curry), and baked
lobster tails.  Plus a rich dessert of some kind like cheesecake,
macademia cream pie, or ice cream.  However, anxious to try more
typical island fare, I make some inquiries.<p>

The entertainment program has also been great.  Last night we had
another dance troupe, Keangi ni Marawa (<em>keangi</em> is a kind of
brown coral and <em>ni marawa</em> means "of the sea").  About twenty
men, women, and girls, dressed in pandanus leaves: a crown woven with
points sticking up like the one on the Statue of Liberty and flower
wreaths, braided arm bands, the females with cowry shell belt and
coconut leaf skirt, the men with a woven mat skirt.  The women also
wore woven pandanus leaf bras.  Most of the singing was in unison,
with hand-clapping and foot stomping by the men to provide the
rhythmic impetus.  There was only one setting on the volume: LOUD.
Usually the women danced up front, but the men and the girls also took
a turn each.  Each number was short, like with the first group we saw,
and the material was also similar: singing about love, fishing,
fighting, sailing--the everyday activities of Pacific island life.
The women's dance was hula-like, with swaying hips, darting eyes, and
sinuous arm motions.  The men's movements were swift and sure, like
martial arts moves, punctuated by clapping, thigh and chest slapping,
and foot stomps.  I speculate why they rotate rows frequently: they
are breathing hard and sweating after a dance number--this is a quite
strenuous workout, even for these very muscular men.  On a few
numbers, the singing became polyphonic a la a church choir, and the
sound was reminiscent of Tahitian choirs sans the abrupt tonal
modulations.  Usually each piece ended with an emphatic shout as if to
signal, hey we're done, wasn't that one great?  As with the first
group, the audience members received a wreath of fresh flowers on the
head.  For the final number they brought out the same drums as with
the first group, but with the wooden box scaled down to about three
feet on a side.  The style for that number was also similar to those
performed by the first group, with acceleration and intensification
towards the finish.  The men pounding the box drum did so with arms
held straight out--not very efficient, I thought, but it sure made for
good theater (there were beads of sweat running down their bare backs)
and was quite loud.<p>

I had asked Polau a couple days ago about the local alcoholic
beverage, the coconut toddy (kaokioki), and tonight the barmaid,
Tekabwere, had a bottle of it for me to sample.  One whiff of that
distinctive aroma and I knew that it was the same as the palm wine of
West Africa.  Of course, different palm trees produce different
flavors of sap; to me this coconut tree sap tasted more like kamakuli
rather than poyo (if you ever lived in Sierra Leone you'd know what I
mean).  It had been fermented for a day, so the slight alcoholic bite
was noticeable and there was no sweetness to it.  I gave it to one of
the NASA guys and he described it as tasting like the fluid that
surrounds canned ham.  Maybe he had something there in terms of the
smell, but the taste is quite different, I think--it's slightly tart
and bubbly.  Anyway, it's an acquired taste, but for me there is the
element of nostalgia, so I drank most of it myself.  Tekabwere (who
says she only likes the fresh (non-alcoholic) stuff) also let me try
the boiled down sap called kamaimai.  It looks like maple syrup and
tasted a bit like light molasses with a tinge of sourness.  This is
the local sweetener when refined sugar is not available.  It would be
quite good on pancakes.<p>

<h2>Mon, Mar 15</h2>

Yesterday morning I borrowed a bicycle from Anna (John Bryden's wife)
and attempted to make a circuit around Manulu Lagoon.  It was a
one-speed banana bike with fat balloon tires and seat too low for me.
The wind was fairly stiff, so it was quite a workout heading into it.
Once away from the inhabited areas, the amount of strewn garbage went
down dramatically, and I was able to enjoy the sight of natural
detritus like bleached out crab shells, white as chalk.  A dirt road
continued around the perimeter of the lagoon.  I did not encounter a
single person or habitation.  Only salt bush grew out there, and there
was no shade anywhere from the sun, which was almost directly overhead
as it was nearly equinox and this was only two degrees north of the
equator.  But the air was not unbearably hot and clouds drifted by to
sometimes diffuse the sun's rays.  Unfortunately the road came to a
dead end in the middle of a sooty tern nesting area.  My presence was
upsetting them, so I turned around and traced my route back.  The
round trip took about 2.5 hours.<p>

About three miles across, the Manulu Lagoon is used for salt making,
but after the British left, its productivity nosedived.  Generally the
residents do not seem too interested in capitalistic ventures.  For
the most part they maintain their traditional subsistence lifestyle
based on fishing.  This morning I had coffee with John and Anna, who
is Gilbertese.  The term "local" or "native" takes on a slightly
different dimension here where the history of permanent settlement
only goes back about forty years, with independence only coming in
1979.  John is of Scottish descent, but he has lived here for thirty
years and has taken on Kiribati citizenship, so he is as local as
anyone else.  He speaks Gilbertese fluently and has become the natural
liaison for foreign groups such as NASA wanting to use Christmas as a
base of operations.  He may be the largest local private business on
the island, with a gas station, garage, and a small general store,
which doesn't have much but did stock a color inkjet printer.<p>

Being old-timers, the Brydens are a good source of information.
There's been a steady influx of new residents from Tarawa (Kiribati's
capital), where there are something like 8000 acres of land for 30,000
people.  This year, with La Ni&ntilde;a, they are having a severe
drought, and are calling for international aid.  Christmas Island, on
the other hand, is still sparsely populated and the water supply can
accommodate more people.  However, if the population growth isn't
moderated, this place will eventually become intolerably overcrowded
also.<p>

<h2>Tue, Mar 16</h2>

There is this confusion about what day it is on Christmas Island.  It
used to be that the international date line cut through the middle of
Kiribati, an island nation of only 280 total square miles of land but
spanning 3000 miles east-west over the ocean, which is about the
distance between Los Angeles and Washington, DC.  Because of the
one-day difference, the government in Tarawa (west of the date line)
could only communicate with the government of Christmas (east of the
date line) three days out of the work week when both sides were in
their respective offices.  So, Tarawa being the capital, they decided
to reroute the date line around the eastern edge of Kiribati.  A side
effect of this sleight-of-hand was that Caroline Island is now the
first permanently settled place on Earth to see the dawn of the new
millennium.  Caroline Island, accordingly, has been renamed Millennium
Island, and preparations have begun to accommodate the masses of
people expected to converge there on millennium's eve.  (Some people
suspect that that was the real reason why they moved the date line.)
It seems to be not a big deal for the residents of Christmas, as they
keep their time according to the tides anyway.<p>

There is some mix up in the currency, too.  Even though Kiribati uses
Australian currency, it has also minted some of its own coinage.  I
got two 10-year independence commemorative two-dollar coins when I
bought a bottle of baby shampoo for six dollars.  But perhaps the most
confusing thing for foreigners is that "ti" is pronounced like an "s"
in Gilbertese; hence, Kiritimati for Christmas and Kiribati for
Gilberts.  No one I asked could explain why the missionary who
originated the writing system came up with this nonsense.<p>

Today I decided to take a drive out to the other end of the island,
where the town of Poland is situated.  I recruited a couple others to
go along.  Christmas Island is shaped like a fat crescent wrench with
its open mouth pointed west and the handle sloping southeast.  The
Captain Cook is located on the northeast side of the head and Poland
is on the lower (southwest) side of the jaw.  Because there are
lagoons in between one has to make an excursion down into the handle
part and then back up the other side.  The one-way trip is no more
than 30 miles, but it takes almost 1.5 hours.  Along the way we pass
through picture-postcard lagoons--that combination of palm trees,
milky blue-green water, chalk-white ground, and puffy cumulus with a
greenish tinge on their undersides, which appear in tropical paradise
posters.  On close inspection, though, there is foam at the edge of
some lagoons, and others are red and sludgy with algae.

We are searching for a swimming beach that is supposedly near Poland.
All the ocean beaches that we've been to have coral in the water and
is either too shallow or too rough to swim in.  There is a decent
swimming lagoon near the hotel, but we want to swim in the ocean.

When we finally get to Poland, we can't manage to find the mythical
beach.  So making the best of things, we walk around a bit in Poland,
which has an area for drying coconut meat (copra) and a Catholic
Church.  The islanders are either Catholic, Protestant, or Bahai.
Houses have wooden sides with open windows and corrugated metal roofs.
Laundry and fish hang out to dry in the sun.  There is a roofless
structure with palm frond fencing and a pit inside that we guess is
used for cooking.  As in every village there is the large, peaked-roof
structure with no walls (<em>mwaneaba</em>) that serves as the
community gathering place.  We try the few words of Gilbertese we know
on the kids: "Mauri " (hi), "ko uara" (how are you), "te merumerung"
(fine), and "ko raba" (thank you).  Even though this is a materially
very poor place, I've noticed the total absence of begging that is a
problem in many developing areas of the world.  The government is
worried about the Western material world insinuating itself on its
residents, and there are wage controls to keep the living standard
fairly even throughout the islands.  There is no TV on Christmas
(although some people own VCRs), and it was only a few months ago that
a local radio station opened.  (It seems to broadcast rather
sporadically during the day.)  The music is an eclectic mix of local
(Kiribati) pop, other tropical flavors like reggae, and American music
like country-and-western.<p>

Driving back, we turn onto what we think is a short cut through the
lagoons.  The road becomes narrow and rutted, and we scrape between
the salt bush encroaching from both sides.  Suddenly we come out into
a clearing where a family is taking an afternoon break on a woven
pandanus mat spread in the shade of a grove of palm trees.  Nearby,
there is coconut meat spread out to dry on the ground.  They look
rather amused as we bump along, eventually coming out onto the same
road that we took on the way out.<p>

Lobster continues to be featured on the dinner menu, and I'm starting
to get a little sick of it.  But the kalua pork (shredded pork with
cabbage) is good.  After dinner we have the final (for the fishermen
who are here for a one-week package) entertainment program: a mixed
choir singing four-part harmony accompanied by two guitars.  They sing
in both Gilbertese and English.  Of the four groups we've seen, their
singing is the closest to the classical bel canto style that is the
standard of "good singing" in Western music, although the vibrato is
still suppressed.  The music is what one might expect of a Hawaiian
church choir.  They are also attired more in the Western mode.<p>

<h2>Sat, Mar 19</h2>

Yesterday, Tekabwere brought me raw fish prepared local style,
<em>raniben</em>.  The sliced raw tuna was steeped in a mixture of
coconut milk, curry powder, and chopped onions.  Like coconut milk
curry.  Tasty.<p>

This morning my boss and I drove in to London, because we heard that a
priest there was selling postcards.  London, situated across the
channel from Paris, is the administrative center of Christmas Island.
Along the way we stopped to look more closely at the seaweed farms.  A
sign on a building reads "Atoll Seaweed Company" and it has the EU
logo on it.  It is partly an European aid effort and the produce is
shipped to Denmark for processing into carrageenan, which is often an
ingredient in commercial ice cream.<p>

In the shallows of the lagoon are dark rectangular patches demarcated
by wooden posts.  I wade in to see how they are set up.  Each seaweed
is tied onto strings that are stretched out in neat rows between the
posts.  In this way the seaweed is kept from being swept around by the
wind and waves.  These farming plots stretch out for a good 100 yards
into the lagoon.  A man wades out with a wooden stick sharpened to a
point on both ends, and we first think that he is going spear fishing.
It turns out that he is making a maintenance round of the plots, using
the stick to dig out faulty posts and replanting them.  Two other men
are harvesting the crop using a floating "barge," a basket equipped
with buoys on the bottom for floatation.  They bring the filled basket
to shore, then spread the seaweed out on nets laid on the ground.
After drying for a while, women then come out to sort out the seaweed
in some fashion (maybe by color?).  The seaweed is about as thick as a
round extension cord with stubby branches growing off of the main
trunk.  It is smooth and rubbery, and comes in colors ranging from
lime green to dark brown.  It is solid and slimy inside when you break
it.<p>

The priest is a Frenchman, who has lived in Kiribati for over
thirty-five years.  He is voluble and tells us various stories as we
wait to get our packs of postcards stamped with his special new
Kiribati millennium stamp.  He shows us a February article about how
the first mass of the millennium will be celebrated in Fiji, then
counters triumphantly with a faxed precis of a New York Times piece
stating that Kiribati has "won" the race to the first dawn of the
millennium.  His office has bookshelves full of religious texts,
French novels, and quite dated French magazines.  An open cabinet
holds medicine and first aid material, framed photos of local and
French scenery adorn the walls (he took all the pictures on the
postcards), and, for some unknown reason, a doll of Disney's
Pocahontas is perched inside a sconce.  In the adjoining kitchen, a
woman and a girl giggle, apparently at the visitors.  I ask the priest
how long it takes by boat from Tarawa.  He says that normally it is
about two weeks, but that the last one took five weeks because it ran
out of fuel on the way.  They had to wait for a Korean fishing vessel
to come along and provide them with fuel.<p>

After dinner and the flight briefing, I hang out over a beer with
Tekabwere.  I bombard her with questions about Kiribati.  Although her
family is from Nikunau, she was born and raised on Christmas.  Because
there is no high school here, she went with the rest of her
schoolmates to Tarawa for three years.  At that time there was no
telephone service, so she kept in touch by letter and by ham radio.
She said she was very homesick.  She came back and has been working at
the hotel for ten years.  Even though she plans to live on Christmas
the rest of her life, she still thinks of herself as being from
Nikunau.  This is kind of what I had suspected, that there would not
be strong identification of Christmas as "home" for many residents,
simply because of the brevity of its settlement history.

I asked her about the ubiquitous crabs: do they eat them?  They are so
numerous that it's impossible to drive anywhere without squashing a
few.  Even just walking around the hotel I manage to kick one or two
by mistake.  She replied that they are not good for eating because
they scavenge garbage and are too small.  When they want to eat crab,
they trap them and feed them lots of coconuts for a while before
cooking them.<p>

<h2>Sun, Mar 21</h2>

It began inauspiciously with the guide showing up an hour late, but
the bird sanctuary tour was quite satisfying.  We started out driving
all the way to the southern end of the island where masked boobies
make their nests.  Laying their eggs right on the ground without any
padding or cover, they are very vulnerable to predators like feral
cats.  The wardens here trap the cats, but the ecological balance has
been forever changed by their introduction by the first settlers.  The
male and female look almost identical; one can only tell them apart
easily when they vocalize--the females quack and the males whistle.
They are the heaviest birds on Christmas (heavier than the frigate
birds, which have a far greater wingspan), and they need to have a
significant headwind to run into to get aloft.  Once in the air, their
thin, long. tubular body--white with black fringed wings--look quite
elegant.  They nest any time of the year and lay two eggs, although
only one usually hatches.  We are able to walk right up to their nests
without them taking flight, even the ones with eggs.  Apparently
humans are not viewed as predators.  They hunt milk fish that dwell in
the saltwater ponds.  Frigate birds sometimes try to steal away their
meal, and we see such a fight happen right in front of us.<p>

Down on the south end is also the site of the atomic bomb tests.  It's
hard to glean exactly what took place here--I've heard different
stories from different people.  The best that I can make out is that
balloons were launched from here, which contained atomic triggering
bombs.  They were detonated in the air.  We toured the remains of
bunkers and the launching pads.  Full-scale hydrogen bombs were
exploded off shore, also in the air.  The story goes that millions of
sea birds on the island were killed, not instantaneously by the blast
but more slowly because of the blinding flash.  Our guide, Bill, does
not know much about the history.  He says he did not pass the exam for
secondary school and did not go to Tarawa.  At the time (in the early
'80s), he says there was only one teacher on the island.  Now there
are several.<p>

Next we go out toward the northeast coast to look at the sooty tern
nesting grounds.  The density of birds flying overhead is astonishing.
One is reminded of Hitchcock's The Birds.  However, even though we
come within a few yards of the young still unable to fly, they do not
swoop down too close to us.  They just make a raucous racket of
squawking.<p>

Back on the road we spot a young booby trying out its wings.  But no
go.  The wind is not strong enough.<p>

We cut back inland through rutted roads that sometimes look like
asphalt, although Bill assures us that it is a natural formation.  The
color of the lagoons is a fantastic milky jade.  Once in the inland
lagoon region, the scenery becomes very hard to distinguish from one
spot to the next--on such a flat island with minimal vegetation (out
here there are no coconut trees), there are no landmarks.  It reminds
me, in this respect, of the coast of Greenland in the summer, where
there is a lake in every hollow of the rolling, tundra terrain and
each climbing of a ridge reveals a vista similar to the one before.
After a while, though, we come to a place where stubby, little trees
about four feet high with waxy leaves dot the landscape.  In nearly
every tree is a frigate bird nest.  It is now mating season and the
males inflate their crimson necks into volleyball sized balloons to
attract the females' attention.  We see some of them fighting over a
roost.  A female rests impassively nearby.  She does not flutter a
wing as we approach close to her.  Those balloons must affect the
aerodynamics of flight, providing much more drag.  The mating game can
be quite an ordeal in this part of the biosphere, too.<p>

<h2>Mon, Mar 22</h2>

I drive into London in the afternoon to pay for the bird tour and mail
some postcards.  All the government offices are located in one area,
two wooden buildings with corrugated metal roofs facing each other
across the street.  There is no one at the post office window.  I
query next door at the telecom window and am assured that the post
lady will be back in a few minutes.  So I wander about town and return
in half an hour.  Still no sign of the post office clerk.  So I leave
some money with the telecom folks and ask them to post the cards for
me.<p>

On the way back I stop to look at a cemetery.  A plot of land
extending from the edge of the road toward the ocean, it is a small
clearing claimed from the surrounding salt bush.  Most of the graves
are simply rectangular pits covered with coral sand and framed by
rocks; typically the headstones are unmarked.  Some have concrete
sarcophagi, a few have wooden sticks posted around the plots, and a
couple have a zinc pan canopy overhead with names and their vital
dates listed on plaques.  I remember seeing gravediggers a couple days
ago at the southwestern edge of the cemetery, and, sure enough, a new
grave is there with flowers still unwilted.  I estimate about 150
graves in total.  For a mostly Christian population, the familiar
iconography like crosses and angels are notably absent.  One dies on
Christmas without much of a visible trace.<p>
