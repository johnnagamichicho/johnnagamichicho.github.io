<h1>The Geography of Desire</h1>

Recently I reread <em>The English Patient</em> after having watched
the film version with some annoyance.  I should know better than to
expect a wholly successful mapping of the many-layered pleasures of a
literary novel to a 2.7-hour movie.  But having read the book first
dooms one to having the rich and malleable world of the novel created
in the mind by text and imagination reduced to the two-dimensional,
time-limited exactitude of celluloid projections.  Telling oneself
that the two are entirely different products and should be enjoyed on
their separate merits hardly works because of the human fallibility of
not being able to forget.  And, if you've lived long enough to love,
you know that not being able to forget is a far greater burden than
forgetfulness.  Stories are told because of this universal frailty,
and this is how Alm&aacute;sy (the "English" patient) slowly reveals
his life to the reader (and the viewer) through fragments of indelible
recollections narrated to his nurse.<p>

This story-within-the-story, as well as the other episodes and yarns
in the novel, spin their way about the geography of desire.  What do I
mean by this?  Is desire a realm to be surveyed by expeditions and
staked out with boundaries?  Does desire have mountains and valleys,
deserts and oases?  Can one build railroads and bridges across the
landscape of desire?  Are battles fought with rumbling machines, and
territories won and lost through acts of bravery and treachery?  Can
one get lost and disappear into the shifting dunes of desire?<p>

"Longing, we say, because desire is full / of endless distances."
Lines from a poem by Robert Hass.  Desire requires at least two
points, A and B, that are separated by a generalized "distance,"
which can be space, time, culture, language, vows, a mechanical
conundrum.  A longs for B, and in between lies the geography of
desire, which can be as vast and forbidding as the Sahara, as
irreversible as time itself, or as full of terrible potential as an
unexploded mine field.  Michael Ondaatje pieces together a wondrous
collage of the many facets of this geography in his novel.  Anthony
Minghella's film elects to focus on one of them--Alm&aacute;sy's reaching
back in time to his tragic love affair with the wife of his colleague
and friend.<p>

The balance in the book, however, is more even with the other major
romance, the one between the Canadian nurse, Hana, and Kip, the Sikh
defuser of bombs.  In the deserted Italian villa where Alm&aacute;sy
lies dying under Hana's care at the close of World War II, their
desire for each other must traverse across many hidden fault lines of
culture, self-mythologies, and history.  Ondaatje, a Canadian of Sri
Lankan birth, charts their missteps and embraces with a deft authorial
hand.  The only part that does not ring entirely true is the effect on
this intimate landscape by the bombing of Hiroshima that follows the
logic of the book's irony rather than the hearts of its characters.<p>

Other ironies abound.  Alm&aacute;sy is an explorer who maps out the
desert, but ends up despising borders.  He loathes ownership, and yet
he stakes out regions of his lover's body as his own.  Kip, whose job
it is to thwart the most powerful desire of them all--a bomb's desire
to fulfill the second law of thermodynamics as quickly as possible.
Hana, the war nurse, whose father dies in the field for lack of
medical help.<p>

The one aspect in which the film excels over the novel is in the
characterization of Katharine Clifton, Alm&aacute;sy's married lover
played by Kristin Scott Thomas.  Because of Minghella's decision to
concentrate on this relationship, it had to be more fully developed
than as sketched out by Alm&aacute;sy's vignettes scattered throughout
the novel.  On screen she becomes more than the object and destination
of Alm&aacute;sy's desire, i.e., she is given a voice as much as Hana
and Kip are given theirs in the novel.  One of the best scenes in the
film is one that is not in the book.  It is an interlude in a Cairo
hotel room where Alm&aacute;sy and Katharine are meeting in secret.
The lovers' dialogue captures the quicksilver mood changes that pass
in real life--nostalgia, teasing, a burst of anger, brooding,
tenderness--at intimate moments stolen from the desolation of a proper
existence.<p>

Longing across longitudes.  Your absence undermining the horizon.  It
does not fall off inversely with distance, neither does it decay
exponentially with time.  And, yes, one <em>can</em> get lost and
disappear into the dunes of desire.<p>
