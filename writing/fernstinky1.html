<center><h1>1. Where is Stinky?</h1></center>

Fern was sorry.  She had gotten into a fight with her best friend
Stinky the day before and had said some mean things to him.  Like<p>

"I hate you Stinky!"<p>

And<p>

"I am NOT your friend anymore!"<p>

It all started when Stinky had come over to play after school as
usual, and they couldn't agree on what to do.  Fern wanted to play
checkers.  Stinky wanted to go outside and play catch.  Usually they
could agree to do one thing then the other, like<p>

"We can play catch, then come inside for a snack, then play checkers."<p>

But somehow yesterday neither of them was in the mood to do what the
other wanted.  Maybe it was because Fern had not gotten the part she
wanted in the school play.  Maybe Stinky was still mad about not doing
well on the spelling quiz.  But whatever it was, before Fern knew it
she found herself calling Stinky names.  Like<p>

"Stupid."<p>

And<p>

"Poopy."<p>

Stinky called her names, too, and that hurt her feelings.  By the time
Stinky stormed out of her house, he was yelling that he never wanted
to see her again.<p>

Today was Saturday.  As soon as Fern woke up, she knew she had to
apologize to Stinky.  Of course she still wanted to be his friend!
But she felt a little bit shy about telling him she was sorry.  She
hoped he was sorry about the fight, too.  She thought of how she could
let Stinky know that she was sorry.<p>

Maybe she could bring him flowers.<p>

No, bad idea.  Stinky was allergic to most flowers.  He would think
that she was being mean to him.<p>

Maybe she could bring him some candy.<p>

Nope again.  Stinky's mom would get mad.  She didn't want him eating
candy--she thought Stinky was getting too fat.<p>

Maybe she could write him a poem.  She tried writing a haiku, which is
a kind of Japanese poem that she had just learned in class:<p>
<pre>
	Stinky's my best friend
	The skunks are jealous of him
	Because he's stinky
</pre>

Ha ha ha ha ha!  Oops.  Better not show this to Stinky.  She quickly
crumpled up the paper and threw it in the waste basket.<p>

Oh dear.  Try as she might, she could not think of a good idea.
Finally she decided to just walk over to his house and tell him that
she was sorry.<p>

When Fern rang the doorbell, Stinky's father came to the door.

"Stinky?  He's still sleeping in his room.  You can go up and wake him
up.  It's almost noon."<p>

Fern tiptoed upstairs and slowly opened Stinky's door.  She wanted to
surprise him.  But Fern was the one who was surprised.  The room was
empty!  Stinky's bed was neatly made, and he was nowhere to be found.
When she ran downstairs to tell Stinky's parents, they had no idea
where he was, either.<p>

Where is Stinky?<p>
