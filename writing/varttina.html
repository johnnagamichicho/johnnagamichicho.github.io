Pop music, viewed from a global perspective, has a funny way of
periodically unleashing on the unsuspecting world a startlingly
``new'' form: the postwar explosion of the <EM>mambo</EM> and <EM>
rumba</EM>; the British Invasion, <EM>bossa nova</EM>, and <EM>salsa</EM> of the
Sixties; reggae in the Seventies; <EM>merengue</EM> and <EM>zouk</EM> in the
Eighties; and hip-hop in the Nineties.  From the local viewpoint,
though, the roots of these ``fresh'' styles are always discernible in
the continuity with the older music, whether it is the <EM>son</EM> and
<EM>guaguanc&#243;</EM>, rhythm-and-blues, jazz and <EM>
samba-can&#231;&#227;o</EM>, rock steady, <EM>cadence</EM>, or dub.  So what
appears to the world like the sudden flowering of the pop-musical
culture of country X is, to the inhabitants of X, simply the result of
a long process of tradition, evolution, inspiration, and synthesis.
And, for whatever combination of reasons, at certain times a local
music will jump over the usual linguistic, ethnic, and socio-political
barriers to become wildly popular across the globe.  (Of course, it
doesn't hurt to be ``discovered'' and relentlessly promoted by a
multinational record company.)
<P>
Recently the world has ``discovered'' Finnish pop music.  Yes,
Finland.  A country with only five million people that was long in the
insecure shadow zone between the Soviet Union and the West, it appears
to have caught artistic fire since the collapse of the Communist bloc,
especially in the fields of music and film (witness the droll,
border-hopping comedies directed by Aki Kaurismaki, sometimes called
the Jim Jarmusch of Finland, and his creation, the Leningrad Cowboys,
who are the Spinal Tap of Finland).  It has received the
attentions of ethno-music popularizers and those of
international record labels.  But, with apologies to the Leningrad
Cowboys, the group that is contributing most to spreading the Finnish
sound throughout the world is V&#228;rttin&#228;.
<P>
How do I describe the V&#228;rttin&#228; sound?  First try: Wall of
estrogen.  V&#228;rttin&#228;, in its current incarnation, is fronted by
four women singers.  And it is their voices that dominate.  One chord
blast from them will immediately convince you that the standard
Western European <EM>bel canto</EM> vocal style never made it across the
Baltic.  The absolutely unwavering, vibratoless attack of these women
have more in common with Bulgarian women's choirs than with, say, ABBA
from neighboring Sweden.  Their singing is bracing and energizing (one
could almost imagine the vocal technique applied to punk rock), but
also clean and pure in that the harmony locks in very tightly due to
the lack of resonant overtones and pitch fluctuations.
<P>
The vocal quartet is backed by an acoustic band consisting of topnotch
musicians from both the folk and rock communities playing a mixture of
instruments--such as <EM>kantele</EM>, accordion, <EM>bouzouki</EM>,
violin, guitars, bass, and drums--that are drawn from both musical
arenas.  V&#228;rttin&#228; writes their own music, but much of the
melodic and lyric material is drawn from traditional songs of the
various regions of Finland: Karelia, Setuland, Mariland, Ingria, etc.
Another distinctive feature of these songs are the irregular meters
(5/8, 7/8, 13/8) that are used liberally (or perhaps just naturally,
as they follow the meters of the rhymes).
<P>
The reference to estrogen I made earlier does not only concern
V&#228;rttin&#228;'s high-pitched vocal assault.  Many of their songs
are written from the point of view of a village girl who lives within
the confines of the traditional expectations of marriage, but is
discovering her sexual power over boys or the credible alternative of
singlehood.  Examples from the album <EM>Seleniko</EM>:
<P>
<P> 
``Matalii Ja Mustii'': Let's all young girls sing so loud that
everyone can hear.  In this village the boys are just like pigs in
their pen and the girls are just like the crows of our village, but I
am like a small cat who wants to purr on boys' arms.
  <P>
<P>
<P> 
``Hyv&#228; Tytt&#246;n&#228; Hyp&#228;t&#228;'': It is good to live as a
maid.  The old man will never scold or chide you and you don't need to
quarrel with him.  Dear mourning maidens, don't mourn for suitors.
You don't have to live in a stranger's house and fawn upon your
mother-in-law.
  <P>
<P>
One can only speculate on why Finland has produced a pop music so
distinct from those of their neighbors.  Perhaps it is not so
surprising given the uniqueness of their linguistic heritage.  The
Finnish language does not belong to the vast Indo-European group, but
together with Estonian and Hungarian forms the Finno-Ugric group.  As
soon as you pick up a Finnish newspaper you realize how ill-matched
the language is to the Latin alphabet (much like how the Japanese
language fits poorly to the Chinese characters that were imported long
time ago); full of double letters and umlauts, some words are so long
that they don't fit into the standard column!  To me the herky-jerk
meters and the defiant vocal charge of V&#228;rttin&#228; are just
another aspect of the intriguing mixture of accommodation and
independence with which Finland faces the world.<BR>
