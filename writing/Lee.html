<h1>Mistah Lee</h1>

Lee runs the rough blade of his cutlass across the ruddy, smooth skin
of the guinea mango; the chipped edge catches, piercing the epidermis,
slicing out cleanly a thick, convex piece, the sticky, acrid juice
flowing through his holding hand.  He sets aside the seed-exposed main
body, cups the independent piece in his hand and scores the almost
translucent meat into a grid-like pattern with the blunt blade-tip,
criss-cross, criss-cross, <em>I wonder if this seed would take hold
back home</em>.  He inverts the convexity into a concavity, the skin
turned inside-out, the flesh now exposed in bite-size rectangular
chunks as if they grew that way--discrete, logical, vulnerable.  He
bites into the slippery morsels, heedless of the mildly caustic syrup
that trickles down his jaw, throat, bare chest.  A gust blows across
the veranda where he is sitting, streaking the juice across his
abdomen.  The dim outline of the Fouta Djalon mountains on the horizon
is rapidly being shrouded by the black-as-coal-smoke tropical
cumulonimbus clouds, thunderheads roiling over the top, silent
lightning flashes backlighting random sections.  Lee flings the still
inside-out skin, now bereft of all flesh, frisbee-style, out toward
the rice field.  It soars amazingly far, its particular geometry
creating an airfoil, cutting across the strong wind, landing in a
tangle of cassava plants.  He is proud of this small discovery--he
wonders if the ancient Africans had little flying toys for their
amusement.  When Saidu comes for the evening water he will ask him if
he knows this trick.<p>

The temperature and light is decreased drastically as if night had
fallen prematurely.  Watching vainly for signs of goosebumps on his
body, Lee quickly finishes the remainder of the mango and fetches and
places a bucket under the spout coming down from a corner of the roof.
The wind is falling off. The first of the raindrops are announcing
their arrival on the zinc pan roof; scattered rim shots soon give way
to a continuum of a thousand snare drums beating, beating.<p>

As Lee continues to bask in the relative cool of the deflected mist he
notices a bucket bobbing up from the bramble bushes that lead down to
the swamp.  The expected head then appears beneath the bucket, then
the upper body of a woman.  She is walking briskly and smoothly,
spinal column perfectly vertical, arms at the sides, the bucket
swaying slightly to and fro but stably as if it were just a decorative
hat one put on nonchalantly.  As the path from the swamp to the
village passed next to his house, following custom, Lee had to greet
everyone who went by.  Sometimes he would duck inside his house when
he spotted a group of old women coming in from their farms--they spoke
neither Krio nor English and Lee was somewhat embarrassed and
frustrated by his continuing inability to learn Limba past the few
basic phrases.  They still derived a great deal of amusement from the
mangled speech of this whiteman, this grown man who preferred to wear
shorts and who did not have a wife to cook meals for him.<p>

The full figure of the woman is now visible, the lower half wrapped by
a lappa, the torso plastered by a drenched T-shirt, the inscription on
which is faded and indecipherable from this distance.  It is clear now
that she is a young woman, her well-defined breasts yet undrooped by
the rigor of the child-rearing years.  As she approaches his house her
face remains obscured by the shadow of the bucket, an anonymous figure
within the isolating walls of the deluge.<p>

Lee prepares himself for a greeting, but the girl--she looks even
younger now--keeps moving up the path, head unturned by his existence,
in unbroken rhythm as if entranced.  He can make out the words on the
T-shirt: &quot;Go climb the mountain.&quot; He recognizes it and
realizes that she has it on backwards--the phrase should be on the
back, not the front.  Acting upon some newly intransigent impulse he
calls out to her.<p>

&quot;Eh, sistah.  You no de greet me?&quot;<p>

She turns her head slowly toward him, the extra moment of the bucket
resisting sudden rotation.<p>

&quot;Mistah Lee.&quot;<p>

With a little start he realizes that he knows this girl, then after a
short delay his mind assembles her identity: Fatmata Jalloh, pupil in
Form II.  Not an outstanding student, somewhat lethargic, but socially
well-adjusted.  She is particularly at a loss in his math class, but
this doesn't seem to weigh upon her mind, and as she looks at him now
he feels no heat of resentment, no opacity of shame in her eyes.  She
stares at him, not moving, not saying anything further.  Lee's
unsettling impulse falters for a moment but makes him continue.<p>

&quot;Come here, Fatu.&quot;<p>

He switches to schoolhouse English and invests his words with the
authority of a teacher giving instruction.  Wordlessly she comes to
him on the veranda; she stays standing just outside the cover of the
roof, the bucket on her head catching the thicker curtain that falls
from the edge.<p>

&quot;Put the bucket down and come under.&quot;<p>

Keeping her back straight she bends down on one knee then lowers the
bucket from her head.  Water sloshes close to the rim; under its
surface are the tight knots of washed and wrung garments.  She stands
on the concrete floor of the porch, stares at the amorphous puddles of
water growing around her bare feet.  Lee is squatting on a foot-high,
woven raffia stool, watching her static expression; he has seen this
face many times before: the bank teller in town eating a bean sandwich
and sipping her lukewarm bottle of Vimto with unbelievable languor,
eyes in the general direction of the mildewy Krio sign painted on the
wall, &quot;KEEP YOU KOPOH NAR BARCLAYS,&quot; while waiting
customers--&quot;businessmen,&quot; market women, civil servants,
farmers--stand sweating in the crowded lobby, warding off with a
&quot;shilling&quot; the occasional beggar that wanders in, but each
one mirroring the same mask of negation, an anti-expression, that the
teller wears signalling that time is suspended, that no transactions
are to take place at that moment; it is somehow like the Taoist's
&quot;uncarved block&quot; and the <em>mu</em> on which Zen
practitioners meditate; and yet it is an effortless state and one from
which the subject can abruptly explode into violent laughter in
response to a neighbor's ribald joke.  Whenever he confronts this wall
(as he perceives it), Lee feels desperately alone.  As he gazes up at
Fatu, he feels an extension of the same strange impulse that made him
call out to her; for no reason that he could fathom his heart is
racing.  In a mock stern voice he says, &quot;You know you should
greet everyone you meet, especially your own teacher.&quot;<p>

&quot;Yes, Mistah Lee.&quot;<p>

<em>God, what an asshole I'm being</em>, yet it is only with the next
words that come out of his mouth that he understands why his pulse is
pounding in his stomach: &quot;Fatu, let we go siddohn small.&quot;<p>

Fatmata Jalloh, daughter of a Fula entrepreneur who had wandered south
of the colonial border as a young man to start the first bread bakery
in Kukuna and a Limba mother who sold palm oil at the market, Fatu, at
age fourteen, a responsible member of the Bundu society, a good Moslem
who said her prayers then went to a Catholic secondary school where,
uniformed in a bright azure schooldress, she learned the skills
necessary to be a fine, modern African woman: English, History, Home
Ec., P. E., Agric., Bible, Maths, Geography, Forensics, and Religious
Knowledge; she, who had inherited the caf&eacute; au lait complexion
and the petite, angular features of the Fula, raised her eyes at Lee,
who was now standing, and giggled.  It is, however, a momentary
outburst.  She quickly falls back to her previous state, eyes now
staring past the dried mango stains cutting diagonally across Lee's
smooth chest.<p>

Lightning strikes strobelight the squall-induced murk, thunder
arriving almost simulaneously as soft kicks in the gut.  The
proposition somehow being articulated by someone he barely recognized,
the border crossing completed, Lee now feels compelled, without
choice, to explore the new moral territory that has been handed to
him.  His perceptions continue to operate displaced: he watches as his
hand reaches out to take Fatu's arm, but force is not necessary, they
move together inside.  He sees their journey in snapshots, each
lightning stroke exposing two portraits: Fatu's tin bracelet flashing
bridal-white and its dark image on the wall, glimpse of a shadowy
shackle.  He reaches under his bed for the Peace Corps medical kit
through which he fumbles for a vestige of insensible sensibility; then
under the mosquito net they go, hands quickly denuding body of wet
things.<p>

After a while it becomes clear that Fatu does not have any idea of
what is going on but is very aware of the idea of it.  Little gasps of
pain and disjointed giggles; odd rushes of sadism and alienation.  The
bed convulses in rhythm, its creaking cutting more and more through
the dying rain.  Mosquitos can be heard riding their high-pitched
notes, a cluster chord in variable tuning, swarming along the folds of
the netting, bouncing their hungry bellies against the flexuous
lattice.  Sweat streams down from his armpits, over the hip bones onto
her pinned thighs; she is otherwise perfectly dry, the effects of the
rain evaporated by her body heat; her skin silken, hairless, and
absolutely blemishless save for the Bundu scars on her cheek and upper
pudendum.  Sunlight is already beginning to break through the
departing clouds; the open window, guarded by two vertical &quot;thief&quot;
bars, admits a sudden light that projects the warped square grid
pattern of the mosquito netting on the supine body of Fatmata,
malleable coordinates that shift with each jolt, the smooth landscape
of her body defined geometrically and arbitrarily moment by moment.
As her eyes come into focus she turns her head away from the
brightness, her slender neck revealing perfect, taut sinews.  The bed
noise is alarmingly conspicuous without the rain, and soon people will
be walking about again.  For Lee privacy is still a precious
commodity, but it only seems to come to him in small increments here
in Kukuna.<p>

<em>Holiday...holiday...it would be so nice.</em> Saidu loved to feel
the squish of wet laterite between his toes as he dragged his feet
along the puddles in the rutted path.  He sang the refrain from the
Madonna song over and over--he couldn't remember the verses--in a
soft, accurate voice that remarkably resembled the original.  She was
not bad, but Michael Jackson was still his hero; every other page of
his Geography notebook was filled with lyrics of My-Kell's hits from
&quot;Rock with You&quot; to &quot;Beat It&quot; in a stylized, florid
handwriting using black and red ball-point pens.  One entire page was
devoted to a sketch of the map of Mississippi, U.S.A., with a
miniature figure of the Moonwalker gliding across the city of JACKSON,
prominently marked in red and black ink.  Saidu had discovered the
home of his idol, not in Geography class, but on the map of America
that Bruce Lee had on his bedroom wall.  His discovery was confirmed
by Mr. Lee himself: &quot;Oh yeah.  The town was named after
him.&quot; He was, however, deeply disappointed when he learned that
Bruce had no cassettes of Michael Jackson; in fact, that had been the
first question that he had asked in class after Bruce had introduced
himself as their new maths teacher from the United States (everyone
was surprised; they had assumed he was Chinese).  Of course, when they
learned his name it became obvious who he really was: Mr. Lee?
<em>Bruce</em> Lee, of course!  There was no denying it--he looked
just like he did on screen except a bit thinner.  It didn't matter
that Mr. Lee never admitted the fact--he was only concealing his
identity until those evil men with their chained and flying weapons
descended upon Kukuna in search of the Dragon.  <em>Then we'll see
who's who.  Saidu &quot;Golden Fox&quot; Momoh and the Kung Fu King
will defend this village to the death!  Ai-yaa!</em> Golden Fox
delivered a flying kick to the malevolent trunk of a flamboyant tree.
Hitching up the tan polyester shorts that were always threatening to
fall off the underside of his distended belly, Saidu suddenly paused
to listen closely: some strange noises were coming from the back of
Bruce's house that was now in full view.  Quietly he stepped closer to
the building.  He couldn't hear anything now.  Could it be...  But not
sensing any aura of danger he decided to call out, &quot;M-mistah Lee!
Mistah Lee, I have come for di watah!&quot;<p>

After a momentary silence during which Saidu's gaze darted around for
quick cover from flying knives, an answer came from the bedroom
window, &quot;Saidu, didn't you notice the big rain?  I've got a whole
bucketful from the roof.&quot;<p>

&quot;A...  Of course.&quot;  Actually, Saidu knew perfectly well that Lee
wouldn't want water from the swamp today; he had hoped to listen to
Lee's radio for a while--it was the best one in all of Kukuna.<p>

&quot;Perhaps you have clothes for washing?&quot;<p>

&quot;Look Saidu, I'm very busy right now.  I'll see you later,
okay?&quot;<p>

That sounded pretty final.  &quot;A-all right.  A de go fohs.&quot;<p>

Saidu walked around to the front of the house just to make sure that
the evil intruders were not hiding from his view.  In one corner sat a
bucket that was filled to the brim with clear rainwater.  There was
another bucket on the porch full of washed clothes.  This is not Bruce
Lee's...  Mystified, he wandered back along the path to the village as
quiet voices emanated from the bedroom window.  A girl's voice?
Breaking out in a wide grin, suppressing the indomitable laughter that
was about to issue from his throat, Saidu tore along the driest parts
of the path, one hand holding up a corner of his shorts, dollops of
red clay flying up from the heels spattering his naked backside.<p>

In the weedy courtyard of Kukuna Secondary School stand the restless
pupils in serendipitous columns of Forms I through V, pretending
attentiveness to the oratorial noises of Mr. Benson Tarawalie, whose
homily this morning is about the parable of the workers in the
vineyard.<p>

<em>For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in
the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.  He agreed to pay
them a denarius for the day...</em><p>

Benson is known as Benyai (literally &quot;bent eye&quot;) among the
students due to his walleye.  Unlike many of the other teachers at
Catholic-run K.S.S., he is in fact a Christian and he truly looked
forward to and meticulously planned for his turn in the daily assembly
duties.  Today's talk is one of his favorites, one that he has given
many times: the worker hired at the eleventh hour is paid the same
money as one that had worked all day; the industrious one complains to
the employer but is admonished for not recognizing the generosity of
the owner.  Benyai is beginning to mix up his aphorisms here for
dramatic effect:<p>
 
<em>&quot;Worry not what your neighbor has, ah, that is, do not let
your left hand know what the right is doing.  Keep your eyes ever on
the Almighty, for the last shall be first, and the first shall be
last...&quot;</em><p>

Knowing smiles light up the faces of those that have been made to
stand apart at the rear of the assemblage for arriving late to school,
<em>yes, sah, the last shall be first indeed</em>, but recalling the
caning that will be inflicted upon them after the meeting, they sober
up, picking their noses in gloomy contemplation.  Benyai is crossing
himself, the students following in lackadaisical imitation, at the
conclusion of the Lord's Prayer, and now Mr.  Abdul Kalokoh, a.k.a.
Butterfly, takes the podium in his trademark ronko shirt, the trailing
sleeves flapping like wings as he directs the mandatory rendition of
the national anthem.<p>
<pre>
          High we exa-alt thee, realm of the freeee
          Great is the lo-ove we have for theeee...
</pre>
As soon as the final words, the name of that beloved nation, are sung,
the children scatter in a raucous pandemonium more or less toward
their respective classrooms.  The latecomers, attempting to blend into
the chaos, are caught by an alert Benyai and the mammoth presence of
the indubitable Mrs. Turay, wife of the principal, Mr. B. G. A. (&quot;Be
Gone Again&quot;) Turay who, true to his nickname, is once again absent
from school--no doubt on account of his &quot;business&quot;; his wife, on the
other hand, never misses a single day of Education, relishing her role
as a propagator of the flame of Progress, holding herself up as a
model of the Enlightened Woman. The apprehended are corralled into the
staff lounge where the boys will be flogged by the man, the girls by
the woman.<p>

&quot;Six!&quot; declares Benyai as the children drop their jaws in the ritual
of incredulity that never succeeds in reducing the sentence.<p>

&quot;B-but, sah, last time was only four st--&quot;<p>

&quot;Momoh!  I see that you are volunteering to go first, not
so?&quot; Benyai pulls him over to the center of the room and takes up
the cane.  Saidu slowly bends over to grasp his ankles.  Benyai pokes
him gingerly with the tip of the stick to check for signs of
&quot;secret security,&quot; then swishes the switch a few times for
good effect.<p>

&quot;Wai!&quot; <em>pwhack!</em> The cry of anticipated pain escapes
Saidu's lips a split-second before impact.<p>

&quot;Don't forget to count your blessings, young man!&quot;<p>

&quot;Yes, sah.  One.  Wai!&quot; <em>spakk!</em><p>

Lee is sitting in a corner preparing his lesson plan, nearly oblivious
to the staccato dialogue of corporal punishment that opens each school
day.  Initially he had been repelled by this form of discipline, not
only by the violence but by the dogmatic attitude that perpetuated it:
The African child learns only by the cane.  Then he noticed that no
matter how loudly the child screamed in apparent anguish during the
beating, he usually emerged from the staff room without a trace of
pain on his face.  It was as if the &quot;punishment&quot; was simply
a guise for a much older rite of power, an acting out of roles to
preserve the hierarchy, where the real cost to be paid had depreciated
through formalization, much as the affordable kola nut served as the
proper tribute in meeting with a paramount chief.  It is therefore not
surprising that the men like to argue over the restriction of same-sex
flogging that was a mutated colonial legacy of the British.<p>

&quot;Eh, Mrs. Turay.  Why not take over for Benson?  He done
tire-o,&quot; Butterfly, rolling his bulging eyes behind the steel-rim
glasses, tries to stoke the old debate again.<p>

Mrs. Turay, breaking her stick on the upturned palms of an unfortunate
girl, gives the oft-quoted reply, &quot;Only a man can make a man out of a
boy; only a woman can make a woman out of a girl.  A girl is too weak
to take a man's flogging, and a boy would scarcely itch from a woman's
hand.&quot;  At this exchange between the hulking woman and the spindly,
ephemeral figure of Butterfly, Lee could barely contain his mirth.<p>

&quot;Wetin du you de laugh so, Lee?  I know you Americans don't
approve of this flogging business.  But you see, you don't understand
the African child--dem no go get sense pas you beat am fine.  Noto so,
Benson?&quot;<p>

Benyai, who really did look tired now, explained, &quot;It is a matter
of respect, Mr. Lee.  These children will not respect the black man
unless they are made to feel it in their bones.&quot;<p>

Lee understood, but disagreed with, the unspoken implication that the
children respected him for his whiteness--he didn't feel any more
respected than the other teachers.  He tried to introduce more realism
into their idea of Americans.  &quot;Many American parents do flog their
kids; it's just not done in school anymore.&quot;<p>

&quot;But, I say.  Do you think it is morally wrong?&quot;<p>

&quot;I just think it's ineffective as a disciplinary measure.&quot;<p>

Benyai shakes his head.  &quot;Ah.  You do not understand...&quot;<p>

&quot;Noooo, Benson.  I think say, Lee sabi di African way-o.&quot;  Butterfly
shoots a meaningful smirk at Lee.  Lee smiles back, momentarily losing
the familiar sense of detachment, his perspective now that of an actor
looking out from the stage, secure in the camaraderie of his fellow
thespians.  Word had spread quickly about the whiteman and Fatu
Jalloh, and Lee had been relieved to notice these glances of complicit
approval, which came not only from the men but also from the market
women who joked more easily with him, advising him to buy more of
their food so that he would become more stout, which was their taste
in men.  He feels more comfortable, at home, as if he had turned more
African, his skin darkened by absorption of the moment.<p>

Suddenly Lee's eyes focus on a face peering in at him through a
window.  It is Saidu--he is trying to get his attention in a frantic
pantomime of comic despair.  Unseen by the others who have their backs
to the window, he crosses his eyes and distorts his face in an
inaccurate but cute/cruel caricature of Benyai.  He flashes a bright,
bright smile at Lee and vanishes from that backlit rectangular
frame.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Fatu sits in a padded lounge chair too large for her, the glossy jade
of her fake-satin dress lurching in the vast vinyl sea of magenta.
Her hair is planted in impeccable rows, a gold ring in each earlobe,
fingernails manicured a violent pink, and feet encased in plastic
shoes of matching and equally undeniable color.  A redundancy of
glittery bangles clutters her thin forearms, jangling softly with the
disconsolate, brushing motion her hands are making in mid-air.  She
has successfully fulfilled the esthetics of the &quot;bluff&quot;
through the fortuitous whim of the whiteman (although she let it be
known to her breathless friends that she had seduced him), all for the
price of this love thing that, though it hurt at first, wasn't so bad
after all.  In fact, there were moments as she lay beneath his hungry
weight when she felt a measure of recognition--this need, this wordless
urgency that this man had was something she could hold and understand;
outside of this physical context, she had no comprehension of him; it
was not the language--the words that came out of his mouth made sense
to her, but the source from which they came was as dark and forbidding
as the bush at night: she sensed no need there, and she did not know
if it was merely hidden or was nonexistent; sometimes this scared her.
She knew that he was only here for two years, then it would be back to
America, a land that, despite all the bad things that he had told
her, was still a place of inestimable wealth and luxury, where
everybody owned a car and a machine called a Microwave that cooked
your meal in a turn of the head without fire or smoke.  It was to this
place that all the children dreamed of going some day, where getting
rich was only a matter of working hard.  Even some of the adults
(especially the teachers) were taken by the &eacute;migr&eacute
vision--Benyai, for one, was known to have applied to some twenty
different universities in America, ostensibly to study agricultural
economics, one of which accepted him but without the necessary
financial aid that was almost never given to foreign students.  Fatu
believed that if Lee loved her he would take her home with him.  She
had even begun saying this to her friends with a conviction that
entrenched itself further with every repetition of the litany that
surpassed hope: <em>I am going to America, I am going to
America...</em>  Thus it was with an almost unsustainable despair that
she was handed the definitive proof against his love: the end-of-term
report card with the number &quot;37&quot; under the heading
&quot;Maths,&quot; the indelible red ink of the numerals signifying
FAIL to those parents who could not read.<p>

&quot;Mistah Lee, you do not love me,&quot; Fatu complains sadly to
her shoes.<p>

&quot;Stop saying that, Fatu.  I've already told you it's a matter of
academic integrity; it has nothing to do with how I feel about
you.&quot; Lee appears to be absorbed in a book with a black-and-white
cover that reads &quot;NIGHTWOOD Djuna Barnes&quot;; he replies
without looking up, his eyebrows lowered in concentration.<p>

&quot;But it was only three more points for a Pass...&quot;<p>

<em>The woman who presents herself to the spectator as a
&quot;picture&quot; forever arranged is, for the contemplative mind,
the chiefest danger...a mirage of an eternal wedding cast on the
racial memory...  Such a woman is the infected carrier of the past:
before her the structure of our head and jaws ache we feel that we
could eat her, she who is eaten death returning, for only then do we
put our face close to the blood on the lips of our forefathers.</em>
Lee feels uncomfortable with the book, its visceral imagery leaving a
wake of turbulent doubt, an almost religious guilt that activates his
calming, defensive instinct: <em>This Barnes woman is nuts</em>; he
closes the book and puts it down.<p>

&quot;Look, Fatu.  I had no idea that you took your grades so
seriously.  What I mean is...you're passing more than enough subjects
to be promoted to Form III, so don't worry about it.  It doesn't
matter, okay?&quot;<p>

&quot;I am shamed...&quot;<p>

&quot;Come on, Fatu.  Are you worried about your friends?  Dem de
humbug you?  Well, look youself; you look fine, you get fine dress for
wear, you no gladi for dat?&quot;<p>

Pensively, Fatu studies the cracks in the cement floor.  &quot;Carry
me na America.&quot;<p>

<em>Shit.  I don't want to deal with this.</em> &quot;I've told you
many times you won't like it there.  You'd be a complete stranger, no
family, nobody to speak your language to, school would be much
harder...  I swear to God, people are so unhappy there, you should see
how many people kill themselves or go crazy.&quot; He knows it is no
use--he is speaking in half-truths, or perhaps it is a personal truth
that he would rather not think about, the answer to what his friends
and family had asked repeatedly, <em>Why are you going?</em>, the
question that had only receded with time and distance, lost in the
ambiguity of a culture that did not force a mirror upon his memory and
motives.  Now once again this girl is forcing him to confront himself,
to evaluate his position in some reference frame, and this angers him,
which takes him by surprise--it is the implosive anger of a
self-contained animal that, at the poke of a child's stick, recoils
violently into itself, foaming slowly from its curled lips.  He looks
away, out the window, through which distant mountains are visible in
the hazy atmosphere.<p>

Fatu gets up dolorously from her chair.  &quot;I'm going now.&quot;<p>

Lee does not turn to watch her walk out.  His face is locked in an
absence of expression, his own kind of mask, inscrutable in its
&quot;racial memory.&quot; Women walking to the fields call out
towards his house in greeting.  He remains still, listening to the
fading chatter, holding his breath as if he were taking a break from
time, a temporary respite from his role in this African village.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

It is a moonless night, dark as the inside of a tree trunk, the air
vibrating with the croaking of the swamp frogs and the background hum
of insects.  The house occults the ancient starlights of an entire
sector of the sky, forming a silhouette, a black void inside which
nothing would seem to exist.  Yet on closer inspection we begin to
recognize features in that emptiness: outlines of a short figure
against a window--it appears to be manipulating some long, thin object
that reflects a hint of what little ambient light there is.  The
motions are excruciatingly slow and silent as if to match the progress
of the stars across the night sky.  This goes on for some time before
we suddenly realize that there is a larger figure moving almost as
slowly and silently along an adjacent wall of the house, the line of
perception between the two cut off by the corner formed by the walls.
Finally the larger figure reaches the corner and lifts up a small
object that he is holding in one hand.  In one swift movement he
rounds the corner, points the object at the smaller figure, and with a
<em>click</em> spotlights the thief who is caught in the act of
&quot;fishing&quot; through the window.  The harsh, white beam of the
flashlight shines upon a wide-mouthed face of a young boy, a trembling
hand shielding the eyes, the other hand still holding the evidence of
his guilt.<p>

&quot;Saidu!&quot;<p>

At the sound of Lee's strangely distorted yell, Saidu drops the bamboo
pole and breaks out blindly into the field.  Lee follows without
thinking, the tender soles of his feet bearing down on sharp pebbles
and clumps of bramble, the flashlight beam swinging wildly into the
night.  At some point Lee acknowledges that his feet are bleeding and
that they must be in a lot of pain, but he is gaining rapidly and
running lightly as if he had discarded heavy choices along the way.
It is in a small patch of cassava plants that he catches up and drives
Saidu to the ground.  Pulling the boy up from the earth, Lee unleashes
an open-handed blow to his face that momentarily seems to levitate his
light body, which then arcs a graceful trajectory across the stars,
landing softly in a conspiracy of cassava leaves, face up, bloated
belly toward the sky.  As he raises his head to ascertain his
survival, he stares in horror at the spector of Lee's face, improbably
illuminated by the dropped flashlight, a sudden full moon that floats
with its features frozen in an ugliness for which the boy has no
words, no concept: it is judgment in its purest form, unheated by
emotion, uncolored by self-awareness.  As spasms of shivering rack
Saidu in light of that pale, cold glare, it dawns on him the great
mistake that he had been making all along: <em>This is not Bruce Lee,
no, it's not him at all...</em><p>
