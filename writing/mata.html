<h1>Mata de Pl&aacute;tano</h1>

Bats waft up<br>
From the musty darkness like wafers<br>
Of cardboard ash rising<br>
From a bonfire.<br>
The sun sinks behind us<br>
In a steep arc.  The dusk<br>
Peters out in tropical<br>
Double-time<br>
As fireflies float between trees<br>
Blinking their inscrutable<br>
Rubato.<p>

More bats stream out<br>
Riding the warm halitosis of<br>
The cave.  Their beating wings<br>
Shake down water<br>
And stir the air.  We are<br>
Baptized; our hands flutter up<br>
To wipe our dampened brows.<br>
Somewhere a coqu&iacute;<br>
Coqu&iacute;s its minor 7th<br>
Amidst the encircling<br>
Chorale of crickets.<p>

Unexpected daylight<br>
From our flashlights clears the air.<br>
Our eyes turn like glass beads<br>
In their sockets<br>
Scanning the branches and<br>
Hanging roots for the telltale<br>
Slither.<br>
But only the shadows move<br>
With the shifting light.<p>

Betrayed, we<br>
Squat together in darkness<br>
Sharing the meat of a grapefruit<br>
I had picked from a tree.<br>
Mouths full of juicy sacs we<br>
Tell stories to each other's<br>
Silhouettes.<br>
Our words slip through the<br>
Forest canopy<br>
Pushing their way up<br>
Through the clinging atmosphere.<br>
Overhead<br>
A satellite threads its way<br>
Through the stars.<p>

Somewhere<br>
Inside the cave<br>
The boas are sleeping.<br>
Stalactites are growing drip<br>
By drip by<br>
Drip<br>
As whipless scorpions scuttle<br>
Past the heat of<br>
Decaying guano.<br>
The rhythm insinuates itself<br>
Through their coiled<br>
Sheaths.<br>
The night is endless.<br>
But some day they will awaken<br>
And their hunger<br>
Will draw them out<br>
To the irresistibly flickering edge<br>
Of twilight.<p>
