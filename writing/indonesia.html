<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Indonesia: A Musical Archipelago</H1>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><STRONG>John Cho</STRONG></P><P>

Indonesian <EM>gamelan</EM> music has been well known and loved by
Western cognoscenti for many years.  This instrumental ensemble music
played on a variety of metal ingots, pots, gongs, and drums (the word
<EM>gamelan</EM> refers to the collection of instruments themselves) has
enchanted first-time listeners (including Sir Francis Drake who
visited Java in 1580) with its blend of exotic modality and shimmering
timbre.  Said to have been created by a Javanese king in the 3rd
century, the <EM>gamelan</EM> has retained its ceremonial function in the
royal courts of Java and Bali, while evolving into a modern folk form.
The course of 20th-century European art music was influenced by the
<EM>gamelan</EM>, as Impressionists like Debussy appropriated the
``strange'' five- and seven-note <EM>gamelan</EM> scales to expand the
boundaries of the Western harmonic language.  In the past decade there
has been a remarkable surge of American and European interest in <EM>
gamelan</EM> performance; these days one need not buy a ticket to
Indonesia to attend a live concert, as many major universities have
their own ensembles.
<P>
Despite its high profile across the world, the <EM>gamelan</EM> is not
representative of the whole of Indonesian music.  This should not be
surprising if you are familiar with the vast geographic extent and ethnic
diversity of this archipelago, which is sometimes called a maritime
continent.  With 13,600 islands and 360 ethnic groups stretched across
three time zones, Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population and
is the fourth most populous overall.  The many incursions of foreign
influence--Hinduism and Buddhism from the 3rd to 14th century, Islam
from the 11th to 15th century, Portuguese in the 16th century, Dutch from
the 17th century to World War II, and short-term occupations by the
British and Japanese--have all left musical legacies that are discernible
in today's vast spectrum of folk and popular music.  Here we discuss three
major genres of pop music that have transcended regionalism to become
common across the islands: <EM>kroncong</EM>, <EM>dangdut</EM>, and <EM>
jaipongan</EM>.
<P>
The roots of <EM>kroncong</EM> date back to the 16th century when
sailors brought Portuguese instruments and melodies to Indonesia.
These imported elements were absorbed by the local mixed-race
Lusophones, who developed an urban music that came to be associated
with lower-class rogues called <EM>buaya</EM> (crocodile).  As happens in
most cases this music, originally the domain of unsavory elements, was
eventually assimilated by the respectable segments of society, and it
is considered rather stodgy and old-fashioned by today's youths.
Indeed, on first hearing <EM>kroncong</EM> one may wonder how it could
ever have been considered <EM>d&#233;class&#233;</EM>.  The ensemble
typically consists of plucked string instruments (<EM>kroncong</EM> is
the name of a ukelele-like instrument), a flute, and a female singer.
Over the steadily plucked <EM>arpeggios</EM> that provide the harmonic
backdrop, the singer croons languidly of love, yearning, sadness, and
the beauty of the countryside, as the flute flits up and down the
scales in free-improvisational flight.  Although the instruments and
the singing style are clearly descended from European origins, the
chord progression takes the Western ear by surprise and provides an
unsettling, ethereal flavor to the songs.  The <EM>langgam jawa</EM>, a
regional variant, has an even more local character with its use of
Javanese <EM>gamelan</EM> scales.
<P>
<EM>Dangdut</EM> is far more popular today, and it can be heard blaring from
the loudspeakers of <EM>bemos</EM> (minivans used for public transport),
storefront TV sets tuned to the music video channel, and, at night, from
<EM>karaoke</EM> bars.  As in rock music, there is a fairly wide range of
music that gets classified as <EM>dangdut</EM>, an onomatopoeic word (<EM>
dang-dut dang dang!</EM>) that refers to its modern, hard-edged dance rhythm. 
The instrumentation and song forms of today's <EM>dangdut</EM> are
obviously influenced by rock music, but it has its roots in <EM>orkes
melayu</EM>, a syncretic ensemble music that combined Malay and Western
elements, as well as in Indian film music and urban Arab pop.  The one
singer most responsible for the rise of <EM>dangdut</EM> in the last two
decades is Rhoma Irama, a working-class hero whose songs manage to
combine Islamic piety, social criticism, and family values, while
simultaneously glamorizing his rags-to-riches tale.  <EM>Dangdut</EM> has
also become part of Indonesian cinema, and Irama's 1980 film, <EM>
Perjuangan dan Do'a</EM> (``Struggle and Prayer'') may well have been the first
Islamic rock film ever made.  Women have also made their mark in <EM>
dangdut</EM>.  Elvy Sukaesih, who purveys a more indigenous style, is the
reigning queen, while Detty Kurnia is making headway overseas in the
lucrative Japanese market.
<P>
Emerging from Sunda (West Java) in the 1970s, <EM>jaipongan</EM> has
rapidly spread to other parts of Indonesia, riding the wave of a dance
craze that can be arguably traced back to a decree by President
Sukarno in the early Sixties that banned all ``foreign'' music
including rock n' roll.  Young musicians who had been happily playing
the twist and jive for eager audiences were forced to invent purely
indigenous replacements.  One enterprising student named Gugum Gumbira
Tirasondjaja embarked on a study of rural dance and festival music
that occupied him for twelve years.  By far his most popular
experiment proved to be the updating of a village ritual music called
<EM>ketuk tilu</EM>, which is the name of a pot-gong used in the
ensemble.  The rest of the group typically consists of other gongs, a
<EM>rebab</EM> (spike fiddle), barrel drums, and a female singer-dancer,
<EM>ronggeng</EM>, who is often also a prostitute.  Gugum's contribution
was in expanding and energizing the drum section, redefining the
singer as just a singer, and giving the music a catchy onomatopoeic
name.  In <EM>jaipongan</EM> the gongs are tuned to a pentatonic scale,
while the melody carried by the <EM>rebab</EM> and the vocalist are
usually in a heptatonic scale.  The subtle dissonance between the two
scales comes and goes as microtonal inflections in the melody play on
this effect.  Within a song, the texture alternates between sections
in which the singer lyrically unfurls tales of love, money, and
agriculture over a stately gong cycle, and passages of frenetic
drumming, whooping, and grunts by the rest of the band.  It was hard
to miss the irony when the authorities tried to crack down on <EM>
jaipongan</EM>, offended by the ``overly sensuous'' nature of the dancing,
which was based on an authentically traditional form--the government
got what they asked for.
<P>
The official ban on foreign pop music lasted only a few years, and today's
bands are free to play anything from reggae to heavy metal to covers of
John Denver.  It is a tribute to the vitality of the local musical traditions
that modern Indonesian pop has not been completely dominated by such
foreign forms, as has happened in neighboring countries like Malaysia and
the Philippines.  It's about time that the rest of the world discovered the
flourishing Indonesian music scene beyond the <EM>gamelan</EM>.<P>
