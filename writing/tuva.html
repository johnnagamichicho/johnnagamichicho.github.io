The voice is the most universal musical instrument.  Singing plays a
vital role in all human cultures and even in the social life of other
species such as birds and whales.  For some people, such as the Mbuti
pygmies of Central Africa, communal singing is so extensive that
virtually all activities from birth to marriage to death have an
accompanying polyphonic soundtrack produced in real time by one's
family, one's neighbors, one's friends, oneself.  Other civilizations
have gone through periods in which singing was elevated to such a high
art form that even genital mutilation was deemed acceptable to produce
singers with just the right quality of voice.  Or a singer could
become so beloved by her people, like Umm Kulthum of Egypt, that even
Presidents dared not schedule a speech at the same time as her weekly
radio concert.
<P>
But for all the emphasis placed on performance, either within a
communal context or for public professional concerts, arguably the
most technically virtuosic vocalists in the world are the herdsmen of
Tuva who roam the grassy steppes on horseback alone, singing to
themselves in the otherworldly multiple tones of the <EM>khoomei</EM> style,
imitating the sounds of nature, now the Siberian northerly rustling
the leaves of a larch tree, now the distant thunder of an approaching
storm.
<P>
Tuva is an autonomous region within the Russian Federation with a
population of 320,000.  Its Turkic people have been ruled over the
centuries by Mongolian warlords, Chinese emperors, Russian czars, and
Soviet comrades.  Besides its claim to being the ``center of Asia'' (a
marker planted in the capital city of Kyzyl says so), Tuva has been
primarily known for its prolific issuance in the 1930s of strangely
shaped (diamond, triangle) stamps depicting local life, such as men on
camels racing a train.  Tuva received further publicity when the
physics Nobel laureate, Richard Feynman, fascinated by its utter
obscurity, made a goal of visiting Tuva even though it was closed to
foreigners under the Soviet regime.  Feynman, an avid bongo player,
was also aware of the unique Tuvan singing style in which up to three
pitches could be generated simultaneously by one singer.  Both his
musical and scientific sides must have been piqued by this phenomenon.
His quest is chronicled in the book, <EM>Tuva or Bust!</EM>, by Ralph
Leighton.
<P>
Since the demise of the U.S.S.R., <EM>khoomei</EM> singing has been
extensively documented and recorded by Western musicologists.  One
ensemble, Huun-Huur-Tu, has even conducted successful worldwide tours
in recent years.  Its musical leader, Kaigal-ool Khovalyg, a herdsman
before turning pro, is a master singer and accomplished player of the
igil (``horsehead fiddle'' with two strings) who, also accompanied by
a conch shell, bells, a shamanic goat-skin drum, and a rattle made of
sheep ankle bones in a bull testicle, sings of the legend of a
faithful horse, the beauty of the vertical separation of the sun's
rays just before it sets (the meaning of ``<EM>huun-huur-tuu</EM>''), the
yearning for a faraway loved one.
<P>
The physics of <EM>khoomei</EM> is still not completely understood (if
only Feynman had lived a while longer!), but its basic principles are
known.  Most natural sounds are composed of a base pitch (fundamental)
plus many more tones at higher pitches (harmonics).  Usually our ears
zero in on the fundamental and that is the pitch that our mind assigns
to the sound.  The fewer the harmonics the ``purer'' the sound (e.g.,
a flute does not produce many harmonic tones), whereas the presence of
more harmonics makes the sound ``richer.''  The human voice is
notoriously rife with harmonics.  By dividing the mouth into two
cavities and adjusting the resonant pitches of each, the <EM>khoomei</EM>
singer is able to suppress the fundamental and amplify one or two
harmonics so that our mind begins to register them as separate tones
rather than as one complex tone.  (This is easier said than done, as I
can attest from attempting to follow written instructions on how to
learn <EM>khoomei</EM>.)  The end result is quite unlike anything else,
but might be said to resemble a talking whistle over a double-bass
drone.
<P>
<EM>Khoomei</EM> is also practiced by neighboring Mongolians and a
similar multi-tone technique is cultivated by Tibetan Gyuto monks.
Neo-traditional groups like Huun-Huur-Tuu are stimulating interest in
the technique in other parts of the world, and cross-fertilization
projects are already taking place (Huun-Huur-Tuu is currently
collaborating with a Bulgarian women's choir, whose vocal technique is
also quite distinctive).  The annual International Khoomei Festival
was started in Kyzyl in 1994, and Sapporo, Japan boasts a society
devoted to <EM>khoomei</EM> singing.  Even Hollywood has stepped in,
using the Tuvans on a soundtrack for a film about Geronimo.
<P>
No doubt, however, the best <EM>khoomei</EM> is still performed and
appreciated by that lone shepherd, hunched over a campfire under the
slowly spinning constellations, singing of the wild forests of
Ezirlyyg, of the greenness of the grass after a rare rain, of the
long-haired beauty whose skirts flap in the wind as she rides her
chestnut mare across the steppe . . .<BR>
