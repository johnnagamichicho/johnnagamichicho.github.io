<h1>On the Nature of Memory</h1>

<h2>1. Border Crossing</h2>

Retrospection is a rear-view mirror vision--personal time flowing away
inside a tidy frame, slowing and receding to a vanishing point, the
crux of self-identity.  Periodically we glance into this lifescape if
only to assure ourselves of the comforting linearity of motion; after
all, memory should contain nothing unexpected (by definition)--the
domain of well-worn handles and grating mannerisms.  And yet, at
certain moments, anomalies appear--apparitions in the mirror, ghosts
that populate our carefully edited personal mythology--sharply
delineating self and self-vision.<p>

This fragmenting of oneself--a process somehow akin to "passive"
self-asphyxiation in which one attempts to stop breathing altogether,
only to discover on the threshold that the will is not nearly so
well-defined--occurred to me last night.  (The scene: Champlain, N.Y.
We stop to get rid of all fruits before reaching the Canadian border
(in spite of the location, we had somehow managed to procure a
mango)...)<p>
<pre>
          The radio has emigrated.
          Pulling off the road before
          The border station, we begin
          The ritual: mango, Swiss Army knife;
          Like an intern, with conviction you skin
          The wayward fruit.
          Opaque, acrid juices flow
          Between your naked
          Fingers, through your
          Threadbare skirt, leaving
          Stained cloth windows to your pale skin.
          Diligently, I lick each finger 
          Nagging wounds I must make better.

          Ahead, I see only open fields.
          Then for a terrible moment I taste
          The iron tang of my own blood
          Curled about my tongue.

Think of marriage as a contract.  Pragmatic words from your mother,
the lawyer.  But contracts can be breached, broken, burned to grey
flaky fragments, just as painful photographs are easily set aflame at
the flick of a bitter match.  And yet, memory persists in that mirror
frame, flickering celluloid projections, sometimes skipping, sometimes
stuck on the same image--an inescapable contract, continuously
renewable.<p>


<h2>2. Moment Passed to Reveal...</h2>

A desert, a table, an egg in a white porcelain egg holder.  Crack it
open with the dull side of a butter knife.  It's all soft inside.
You've killed it.<p>

Cut to open sea.  No clouds.  Sun high in the sky.  A raw egg
(shell-less) is floating on the surface, the white stretching and
shrinking with the crests and troughs of the waves.  It is free.  The
yolk is strangely iridescent in the fierce light.<p>

Close-up of snake (small, green one).  It opens its jaws to
full-maximum to accommodate a whole chicken egg.  An incongruous lump
begins to travel down the length of the snake's body.  (Question: Was
it raw or boiled?)<p>


<h2>3. Liebe</h2>

One of the earliest memories I have is of riding in the back seat of
the rickety Austin-Healey with a very sick, immobile Liebe on the way
to the university lab.  The scene exists as a snap-shot in my mind,
with no before or after, a frozen moment of oppressive sadness, just
shades of gray, the road leading off through the windshield into a
vast void lined by skeletal trees.  I doubt if the image of the
outside is correct I don't think there's any place in Tokyo
(especially between our house and the university) where there were no
houses to be seen from the road.  I had been told at the time that
Liebe was being taken to the veterinary school so she could be cured
of her sickness.  In reality she was being put to sleep at the
agricultural animal science lab where my father worked.  Liebe was
terminally ill (from cancer, I think).  My father would sometimes
bring home sausage produced by the same department made from animals
(mostly pigs and sheep, he said) that had outgrown their scientific
usefulness.  He claims now that these were of the highest quality (not
being made for commercial purposes), which I won't dispute.  I used to
poke them through with a chopstick and hold them over the glowing mesh
of the kerosene heater.  They would start to sweat oily drops, then
black blisters would form on the skin--that was the best part to eat.<p>

Liebe was just one in a long line of pet dogs that our family kept and
which kept dying before their full respective lifespans.  Most of them
were before my time; Liebe is the first one that I have any
recollection of, and that only as a snap-shot.  There is a family
folklore about Ben who was buried beneath a sapling Himalayan fir in
front of the house, a tree that in my childhood was the tallest tree
in the neighborhood.  Supposedly the nutrients from Ben's decomposing
corpse nurtured the tree to such heights.  I think he was run over by
a car, but I'm not sure.  When I was growing up there was Peter, who
was a white, cowardly poodle that emitted sticky diarrhea all over his
curly ass whenever he ate watermelon rinds.  Once he streaked
vigorously into the kitchen to get his food (which was usually a
disgusting concoction of boiled stale bread with bits of scrap meat,
milk, and sugar thrown in--I don't know who came up with that recipe,
but I hated the smell of it cooking), missed making the sharp turn on
the slick floor, and slammed with all the <em>MV</em> that he had
built up into the glass jar of <em>umeshu</em> (Japanese-plum wine)
that was brewing.  The jar exploded, sloshing its potent-reeking
contents of olive-green plums and <em>shouchuu</em> all over the
floor, the dog shocked into a frenzy, running around insanely until
finally going into guilty hiding mode with his head stuck behind the
couch--legs, torso, and silly tail in full view.  Peter eventually ran
away or was dognapped, as was his tiny successor, Koro.  After my
father's disastrously fatal experiments with goldfish and tropical
fish as pets, my sister had the brilliant idea of getting a cat, Leo,
who, as it turned out, stayed with us until we abandoned him to move
to America.<p>


<h2>4. A to MIRAGES</h2>

<pre>
                              A girl,
                        naked AS the sun,
                lies by the SEA, dreaming.
                           A SAGE, crouching,
                       plays GAMES with the sand,
              tracing moist IMAGES with a remembering
                  finger.  MIRAGES rage in the distance.
</pre>

<h2>5. Purgatory, Nevada</h2>

What struck him as he drove into the parking lot was the utter silence
of the place.  Neons pulsed, incandescents glowed blood-red, yet the
festive brew of honky-tonk laughter and raucous melody associated with
these carnival lights was conspicuously absent like a film stripped of
its soundtrack.  People were strangely absent, too, as if the cars
themselves had come to congregate here in the middle of the desert to
mutely worship the stars, the cauldrons of their genesis.<p>

With a bittersweet resolve he made his way over resounding gravel to a
chain-link gate equipped with an invisible doorman.  A push on a
button produced a distant ring somewhere inside, and a second later a
surprisingly bellicose buzz from the gate signaled that it was ready
to be entered.<p>

Once inside the building, he was directed to sit down on a threadbare
sofa by a short, violet woman of undiscernable age.  His face flushed
from the accusing heat; clearly, the thermostat was set to point out
the self-consciousness of wearing clothes.  He sank deeper into the
sofa.<p>

Suddenly, a dozen women trooped into the room clad only in leotards of
various hue.  Tall, short, thin, plump, brunette, blonde,
bleach-blonde, straw-blonde--his eyes refused to focus on any
individual.  Despite their disparate shapes and colors, they formed a
collective whole--twenty-four naked legs and too much make-up--a
multi-smiled mythical creature that was even now spewing out the
sounds of female names through each pair of brilliantly painted
lips...Cathy...Katrina...Dina...as he struggled desperately to
overcome the sudden bone-weariness that was paralyzing his senses.<p>

A pregnant stillness: they were expecting.  They were expecting him to
choose.  Forcing thought and motion to take place, he vaguely waved at
a small, wide-eyed woman who seemed to have on the least make-up, and
who appeared to be the youngest as well.  A moment of confusion ensued
as she ascertained her selection with raised eyebrows and index finger
cocked to the suicide position.  The ceremony completed, the unchosens
filed quietly back to their quarters, each one clutching a gift of
disappointment and relief, a microcosm of every rejection they had
ever known.<p>

<em>Hi.  My name is Ada.  Come on this way.</em><p>

He followed the woman down narrow, branching corridors.  It became
apparent that the building was a patchwork of mobile homes connected
at right angles to each other.  When they finally cul-de-saced into
her room, he was momentarily swirled into a vortex of dislocation: the
room was so perfectly normal!  A half-written letter lying belly-up on
the crisply made double bed, perched atop a windowsill a framed
Polaroid shot of an infant, and that double camouflage alienating form
from function--Venetian blinds <em>and</em> curtain.  Somewhere, a clock
ticked.  He found himself seated on the edge of the bed with the woman
who was going through a spiel with a kind of put-on coquetry that was
simultaneously alluring and numbing.  Combined with the relentless
heat and the melancholy scent of cheap cosmetics, her words became a
lavender coercion evoking within him that translucent overlapping of
memory and dreams: dreams of memory, memories of dreams...<p>


<em>High noon, height of summer.  The forest is vibrating with the dense
chorus of cicadas, individual pitches fading in and out like a reedy,
minimalist composition.  He is weaving his way softly through the
shafts of sunlight, a pale, thin child of perhaps seven or eight
carrying a bamboo pole twice his height with a gauzy net attached at
the top.  Intently he scans the upper parts of tree trunks for one of
these sonorous creatures that would mute itself at a mere breath of
danger and become a common knot on the bark.  He would have to be a
ghostly stalker, casting no shadow, stirring no air.  Holding his
breath, he tries to stop thinking.<p>

It is then that he notices an unusually high and transparent voice
cascading from a nearby tree.  Like a soprano sustaining the
penultimate note in a demanding aria, this cicada is singing with a
sharp timbre that is tempered only by a slowly evolving tremolo.
Enchanted by the harsh purity of its song, he decides to pursue this
diva.<p>

It is not difficult to locate the singer.  Entranced, perhaps, by its
own music, it is even easier to net.  Quickly he brings down his prize
and carefully retrieves it with his thumb and forefinger, bathing it
in a shower of sunlight.  Completely at the mercy of this alien
captor, it does not struggle.<p>

At this point, a chilly mist of awareness begins to drift out from the
depths of the subconscious, leaving damp touches of apprehension upon
his consciousness: something has happened...  As he turns his cicada
in the bright light, the answer comes in an echo of nothingness: the
forest has fallen perfectly silent.  Dizzied by the enormity of his
deed, he perceives in the resonant void a flash of greater guilt not
yet consummated, a premonition, a deja vu in reverse, a memory of a
future not yet envisioned...</em><p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Ada was waiting.  Having said her piece, she was waiting for his whim
and wish.  Gazing at her absently attentive face, he realized with a
twinge of dark revelation the real reason why he chose her; for
dispersed in the figure of this strange woman was the ghostly image of
another, familiar and precious, but one that must be set free, must
not be allowed to trespass upon this silence, this empty silence that
is his purgatory.<p>


<h2>6. An Epilogue</h2>

Coming home from work I find her sitting with her back against the
door of my second-floor apartment.  She is absorbed in the ritual of
snipping off her split ends with a large pair of sewing scissors, an
activity that's like a mantra for her, a systematic exorcism of
accumulated doubts and ambiguous memories, SNIP, SNIP.  The roots of
her long, helical locks are showing the true dark of her
hair--peroxide acquiescing to the passage of time, paint peeling, bird
of paradise molting, memory dispersing, a fool believing in renewal,
SNIP.  Think hard, now.  Dirty bare feet, black miniskirt, sky-blue
halter top, pale, opaque skin that never tans.  It cannot possibly
have been seven years...  She looks up.  Smiles.  <em>Oh, hi.</em> I don't
smile.  <em>Hi.</em> Sweatdrops streaming down from my armpits.  <em>What are
you doing here.</em> Etc., etc.<p>

Cut to the inside of my apartment.<p>

<em>Drink?</em> I open my refrigerator.  On the top rack a head of lettuce is
oozing brown goo onto the white bars on which beads are forming.  She
helps herself to some water from the faucet.  Strange how such obvious
dissolution can take place so quietly, so inconspicuously: lettuce
heads almost never explode by themselves.  It's weird, too, how one
assigns values of good and evil to construction and destruction,
repectively.  After all, isn't it just the balance of energy and
entropy--that, and the system's distance away from equilibrium and
proximity to bifurcation points and all that?  Maybe if I can perturb
that lettuce far away from equilibrium it would spontaneously
reconstruct itself.  I grab the dripping organic object from the
refrigerator and, with a terrific howl and tortured body contortions,
I slam-dunk it into the seven-foot-high Nerf basketball hoop.  Not
quite.  Much too large to fit through the loop, the rotting lettuce
head <em>boings</em> off the flexible rim and lands <em>bwut</em> on the tiled
kitchen floor, splattering dark juice, disseminating an odor like a
narrow alley behind a cheap Chinese restaurant.  Damn, it didn't work.
The whole time she's looking at me with those high, arched eyebrows,
slowly sipping the lukewarm, cloudy tap water, fingering those endless
split ends.<p>

It turns out she needs a place to stay for the night.  Seems
circumstance has conspired with itself to converge upon her various
obstacles to prevent her from reaching Sanctuary, DO NOT PASS GO.  Not
an implausible story, coming from her: plane delayed, missed
connection, destination now socked in by fog, remaining flights
canceled, didn't want to stay in a hotel, <em>you know how I am about
sleeping alone in strange places, didn't know anyone here, checked the
phone book to see if you still lived here, tomorrow I'll take the
first flight out.  Please.  Pretty please?</em><p>

She stands at the side of the window shifting her weight back and
forth, her face moving in and out of the static sunbeam, the vertical
shadow's edge rippling back and forth across her cheek, eye, nose,
eye, cheek, bright/dark/bright, yes/no/yes, her big brown eyes playing
peek-a-boo, unblinking, wide open.  I stare back, my weight resting
lightly against the edge of the dining table.  <em>Shit, you're the last
person I wanted to see.</em> She looks away, out the window.  Across the
courtyard, from a half-open window, an obese, hairy arm thrusts out a
kettle and tilts it to water a potted dead plant.  Finishing its task,
the arm-and-kettle abruptly vanishes into the dark rectangle.  She
replies (still looking away): <em>I should go if you can't stand me.</em><p>

Should.  <em>Should?</em><p>

Memory is a funny thing.  A friend tried to explain it to me once.
Memory is storage of information.  Storage of information requires
energy.  Memory can also be converted back into energy, just like mass
can be turned into energy.  Problem is, you can't retrieve the same
memory once it's been turned to energy--it's lost forever; you can only
create different memories.  Did I get that right?  Maybe I'm just
losing more and more brain cells.<p>

In the movies they often employ a common reference point as a segue to
a flashback sequence--the camera zooms in on a pair of juvenile hands
holding a small bunch of white lilies (the HERE-AND-NOW: at the dying
heroine's bedside), pans back to reveal an idyllic
adorable-little-girl-in-green-pasture-with-babbling-brook scene of her
childhood.  Involuntary recall rarely works like that; static images
do not possess such conjurative powers--rather, it is a dynamic
sequence of perceptions (a certain sense of hollowing out as an azure
scent billows past your face, a losing of a game followed immediately
by a tug, a repetition, a warmth in three corners, then the <em>idea</em> of
the number nine) that creates a direct, uncontrollable access to a
past not remembered for a very long time.  As I watch her swaying,
windowed profile, I wish for the right incantatory sequence to happen,
to be there, if only for a moment, where we used to be.  But it is
only memory of the ordinary, effort-laden kind that comes to me, the
picture drawing close to her side profile, the focus blurring out
towards the brightness...<p>

<em>Dawn illuminates her sleeping profile through the window, head
against the glass, her breath periodically forming vapor trails across
the dim sky.  After driving all night they find themselves traveling
more-or-less north toward the border; somewhere along the way, in the
anonymous nocturnal landscape, they have lost track of the exact road
they are taking.  It doesn't matter as long as they are headed north;
for some reason it seems very important to cross the border as soon as
possible.  As the sun rises, the eastern glow fades, cool watercolors
spreading through empty longitudes.  Yellow divider stripes stretch
and pass, then reverse, shrink, in mirrored retrospect.  High-voltage
power lines cast rhythmic shadows catenary scores: Ode to Gravity.  In
the blue solitude they fly--wheat, asphalt, shadow, light.</em><p>

She's picking out the magazines from the heap of the Sunday NYTs that
are sort of piled up in the corner with the standing lamp. <em>How come
all the watches in the ads point to 10:10?</em> Fidgety, I go into my room
to spin up an Ornette Coleman disc.  Eventually.  Focus on Sanity.
Harmolodic free jazz broken shadows.  <em>I see you're still into
cacophony</em>, she remarks.  I lie down on the lifeless shag carpet and
close my eyes.<p>

Exhumations and post-mortems are grim ordeals and best avoided--a dead
relationship is a dead elation, R.I.P., (sh...), but sometimes it's
hard to leave that scab alone: you've got to pick at and play with it
until, <em>aahh</em>, it dislodges suddenly and a pool of familiar pain wells
up. <em>All the new thinking is about loss.  In this it resembles all the
old thinking.</em> Possession is illusory to begin with and yet we keep
feeding each other these deceptions as though the mutual swallowing
forms an eternal ring, ever shrinking, two serpents devouring each
other, converging to a point of nonexistence, receding into the
distance of the frame. <em>Longing, we say, because desire is full of
endless distances.</em> And the longest distances are measured not in
light-years but in units of entropy...<p>

                                       <em>Hey, you awake?  Listen.  I
have to tell you something.</em><p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

She had a fever that night, and I let her sleep in bed with me,
holding her closely from behind, gently pressing my palms against the
pain in her abdomen.  Once I made love to a married woman and the
entire time I could feel her ring against my skin, a gold chill
sliding up and down my back, occasionally knocking against my hip,
metal on bone, a strange resonance of guilt and need.  That was after
my divorce from this shivering woman; we always went to bed with our
rings off.  She has one on now and I'm tempted to ask whether she and
her husband leave them on in bed.  But I don't ask.  She has told me
enough.  Now only I know, and when she leaves in the morning she will
never be back, her husband will never know, and the father of the
now-aborted mistake will never know, she will recover quickly from the
operation, <em>must have caught a bug on the trip</em>; <em>Don't worry, hon</em>,
memories disintegrate, myths emerge, trust and linearity restored,
success, complacency enough to fear for the world, a crisis,
resurgence, children (even), little stigmata of regret, hope, boredom,
separation, an implosion of spark petals, recollections of vague
ecstasy, a long rainy season, absolute despair, the greying, the
wrinkling, distant hunger, decelerating, strange language and music,
rotting and bedpans, a sweet breath, the end, and yet I stroke, stroke<br>
your hair<br>
only because<br>
your hair feels fine<br>
like sunshine<br>
on a remembered<br>
afternoon.<p>
