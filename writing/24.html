<h1>24</h1>

Happy 24th birthday, L.!<p>
    
When I turned 24, the dry season was just starting in Sierra Leone.
It was a welcome transition for those of us from milder climes after
months of the hothouse steam bath that is the rainy season.  But
locals would complain that the eerily dry Harmattan winds blowing
south from the Sahara would parch their lips and crack their skin.
Old women with calloused palms would smear bright orange palm oil on
their sinewy limbs, a prophylactic measure that lent a dusky glow to
their movements and an insinuating scent that cooking was a
never-ending part of their daily lives.  Men might take an extra swig
of that sweet morning palm wine to fortify themselves against the
dusty, dehydrating haze that would blow throughout the day.  The mango
season having ended, children deprived of free snacks would rein in
their wandering and make sure to be at home when the one meal of the
day was served.<p>

But these were observations from the previous year when I had lived
upcountry, prior to moving to the capital to teach at Fourah Bay
College.  &quot;The Athens of West Africa&quot; was what they used to
call Freetown pre-independence, and Fourah Bay, as the only university
in the region, was the reason.  Students from other British colonies
would flock to it, vying to get a leg up in the limited career tracks
that were available to the colonized.  Located high atop Mt. Aureol,
those international elites-in-training literally looked down in
daylight on the plebeians living in the crowded neighborhoods below,
descending at night to enjoy the thriving nightlife, dancing the
maringa to Ebenezer Calender's Krio stylings while nursing a warm
Guinness.<p>

By the time I was there, the long, slow fall from grace was nearly
complete, with the country hitting the bottom of the UN's development
rankings, the years of kleptocratic rot taking its inevitable toll.
Or so I thought&mdash;the protracted civil war would break out just
three years later, plunging the nation into a horrific morass of
diamond-fueled blood letting.  At the time, only a half-hearted coup
attempt marred the Freetown Bicentenary proceedings, while the
military checkpoints that popped up everywhere as a result lacked
menace, as we all knew that soldiers were not given live ammunition to
save the government money.  Resignation leavened by an existential
sense of humor, supplemented by creative small-time hustling, was the
order of the day, and I never imagined that soon the city would be
overrun by drugged-up children being forced to hack off residents'
limbs by competing warlords.<p>

No, the Freetown I knew was a peaceful place.  Regressing and
decaying, but civil and decorous.  Fourah Bay tried to stave off its
decline by clinging to proper British etiquette, such as serving tea
and biscuits to the proctors during exams (a tradition that I liked!).
Students dressed neatly for class and addressed the lecturer politely.
And some still trekked from far-away lands to seek learning.  I became
friendly with a man from Malawi, who came on a fellowship as FBC was
one of the few African universities offering a graduate program in his
field.  He discovered upon arrival, however, that the program had been
cancelled due to lack of funding.  Having insufficient money of his
own to go home to his wife and children, he was stranded at FBC for
the academic year with no classes to attend.  He made the best of the
situation, though, by taking up with a &quot;local wife.&quot;<p>

Teaching at the college was challenging.  Textbooks were not available
and it was too expensive to provide photocopies, so much of class time
was spent simply transferring information from blackboard to
notebooks.  I taught courses in electromagnetics and numerical
analysis methods, the latter requiring computer programming.
Fortunately, the department had its own generator, so despite the
part-time nature of the power grid, it was possible to have regularly
scheduled lab time.  Unfortunately, the PCs&mdash;of British make,
donated by some charity&mdash;lacked any form of non-volatile memory
or data storage, not even floppy disks, so code could only be written
and exercised during the two-hour lab period, after which everything
written would be lost.<p>

As the capital, Freetown was the only city in the country that could
credibly be called modern.  It was a &quot;one place&quot; kind of
place.  That is, there was only one place where you could get ice
cream, one place for Chinese food, and one food cart offering Scotch
eggs.  Needless to say, you could not find any of these things outside
Freetown.  International chains were entirely absent.  As for the ice
cream, it was soft serve made from powdered milk, but it was
nevertheless ice cream.  It was a bit of a trek to descend from campus
to downtown where the Lebanese-run shop dished out banana splits in
pale blue plastic boats, but it was a nice occasional indulgence.<p>

I had a girlfriend, a fellow PCV who was stationed in a remote village
near the Guinean border.  She would ride into town on her
Peace-Corps-issued motorcycle (unannounced, as domestic telephone
service was entirely defunct), covered head-to-toe in red laterite
dust, and proceed to take a bath in my flat, a big treat since she
neither had running nor heated water.  We would ride out to one of the
lovely beaches on the peninsula&mdash;Lumley or River
No. 2&mdash;getting jostled roughly by the roads that had long ago
lost their pavement.  In the evening, we would visit one of the
handful of restaurants in town that served non-Sierra Leonean food.
Although we both loved the local cuisine, it was good to take a break
once in a while.<p>

There's something about being expatriates together in an intensely
foreign environment that can draw people together tightly very
quickly.  C. was enamored of small village life, and talked about the
possibility of getting pregnant and having the baby in her hut with
the help of local women.  Incredibly, in retrospect, I listened to her
seriously and considered how things might play out.  She spoke of
staying on after her Peace Corps stint and raising her child in that
village.  Impractical, romanticized thinking, but at the time it
seemed like a legitimate life choice.<p>

At 24, I had no strong direction in life and was open to divergent
scenarios.  In the end, I decided to apply to one graduate school (it
was very difficult to complete the application process from Sierra
Leone!), and if I got in I would go.  I was accepted, and so I went
back to school.  If I had been rejected...who knows what I would have
done?  It's possible that I might have become a professional
expatriate like your twin aunts.  In fact, I found out years later
during my thesis defense party that my application had been very close
to being tossed&mdash;only an effusive recommendation letter from a
legend in the field for whom I had worked saved it.<p>

As I've said to you before, I'm not a believer in the
best-of-all-possible-worlds paradigm.  At 54, I am perfectly content
and happy about how things turned out, but other parallel lives may
have been excellent as well.  Any way you go there is good and bad, so
savor the good while it lasts.<p>

Love,<p>
J.<p>
