Enticed by what you've heard on the radio, you buy Juan Luis Guerra's
latest album, <EM>Fogarat&#233;</EM>.  Now you're sitting at home
listening to all the songs in sequence.  <EM>Good stuff</EM>, you
think.  But what is that intricate guitar pattern weaving in and out
of the music?  And the rhythmic layers that are not part of the
standard <EM> merengue</EM> percussion lines?  Overall, there's an
undefinably exotic texture that seems somehow strange and familiar at
the same time.  <P> Those of you who are fans of African pop music
will recognize that the Dominican superstar has decided to inject
fresh flavor into his new songs by appropriating Zairian
<EM>soukous</EM>.  Such deliberate cross-fertilization has been a
recent musical trend set by the likes of Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon,
and David Byrne.  For Guerra the choice of African music seems
natural, since, as we all know, one of the main roots of Caribbean
folk and popular music is in sub-Saharan Africa.  Some specific
rhythmic patterns, the call-and-response choral format, and certain
percussion instruments used in Caribbean music can be traced back via
the slave trade to specific regions of Africa.  <P> However, how many
people are aware that Caribbean music made its way back across the
Atlantic to spawn a new generation of pop music all over Africa?  For
example, <EM>soukous</EM> developed out of the <EM> rumba</EM>, which
enjoyed pan-African popularity following World War II.  The
Afro-Caribbean musical connection has never been a one-way street.
Even before the arrival of satellite communication and MTV, music
traveled far and wide to be soaked up by disparate cultures.
Therefore, it is not at all surprising to detect a certain familiarity
in the <EM>soukous</EM> which you hear on <EM>Fogarat&#233;</EM>.  <P>
Because of the colonization by European powers, African popular (i.e.,
non-religious, non-ceremonial) music has a long history of
assimilating elements of Western music, especially the diatonic
harmonic language based on hymns (via the missionaries) and marches
(via the military).  Such harmonic lineage is still readily
discernible, for example, in the South African townships' choral
music, <EM>ingoma ebusuku</EM>, made world-famous by Ladysmith Black
Mambazo.  Also, not surprisingly, the dominant Islamic presence in the
Sahel region has endowed its pop music with Arabic modalities and the
singing style of a muezzin.  This you can hear even in the
internationalized pop of Senegalese superstar Youssou N'Dour.  <P>
Colonialism was also responsible for the diffusion pattern of
Caribbean music across Africa, at least before the maturation of the
mass media.  An early example is how the calypso became the rage in
British West Africa in the 1940s.  Because the colonies tended to
trade within the family, e.g., British West Africa with the British
West Indies and French West Africa with the French Antilles, there was
a steady stream of sailors, traders, and soldiers that flowed between
specific areas of Africa and the Caribbean.  It was inevitable that
some of this human traffic would carry with them the sounds of one
place to the other.  History records that the Kru of Liberia, who
became itinerant sailors during the colonial era, were also skilled
musicians, especially as guitar players.  Coming from a nominally
Anglophone region, they mainly plied the trade routes linking British
West Africa, the British West Indies, and Britain.  They played a
vital role, beginning in the 1920s, in disseminating the various
popular musical styles from one place to another by absorbing new
sounds at one seaport, then reproducing them at another.  One such
song form they picked up was the calypso from Trinidad and Tobago.
Perhaps because the calypso rhythm is essentially African, or perhaps
because the Kru sang in Krio, which was the default trade language of
British West Africa, the calypso became immensely popular.  Although
it did not spread widely to the non-British colonies, it remained
regionally dominant until Africa was swept off its feet by the <EM>
rumba</EM>.  <P> Cuban dance music stormed the globe following World
War II.  Led by Benny Mor&#233; and others, a new, vibrant
<EM>rumba</EM> emerged, which melded the European-inflected
<EM>son</EM> and the African <EM>rumba guaguanc&#243;</EM>.
Distributed widely by record and radio, this music with its
exuberantly African heartbeat had a special and enduring effect on
Africa, which was beginning its process of independence from the
colonialists.  Here was a music that they could lay a claim to, which
was rooted in their own rich rhythmic heritage.  While the popularity
of Cuban music eventually waned in other parts of the world, in Africa
(especially in the Congos, Guinea, Mali, and Senegal) it went on to
influence the development of a variety of pop music such as Congo
jazz, <EM>makossa, soukous, mbalax</EM>, and horn-based highlife.
Since the <EM>salsa</EM> is also a descendant of the <EM> rumba</EM>
explosion, we might say that it is a cousin of those African pop
forms.  <P> Perhaps the introduction of a <EM>soukous</EM> element
into our Top-40 radio, courtesy of Juan Luis Guerra, signals the
beginning of a modern African Wave in the Caribbean.  Language,
however, may be a barrier in the Spanish-speaking islands, since
virtually none of the African music is sung in Spanish.  Thus, it is
not likely that a pan-Afro-Caribbean phenomenon like the <EM>zouk</EM>
in the French Antilles and Francophone Africa will develop here.  But
the strong affinity for African rhythms is deeply ingrained in our
collective musical psyche.  The beat itself is a language which can be
appreciated without an understanding of the text.  Those of us who
love African music hope that the radio stations will be inspired to
anticipate a trend by giving more airplay to the exciting tropical
sounds coming across the Atlantic.  <P>
