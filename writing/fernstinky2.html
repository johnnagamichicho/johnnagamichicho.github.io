<center><h1>The Hole</h1></center>

At first, Stinky's parents thought that he had gone off fishing early
in the morning.  But when they looked in his closet, his fishing pole
was still standing up against the wall.  And his bicycle was in the
garage.  Fern called home to make sure that somehow Stinky had not
gone to her house without running into her.  No Stinky there.
Stinky's parents phoned his other friends' houses: Zeke, Ella, and
Gordo.  But Stinky was not to be found.<p>

Next they looked all around the house to see if he might have fallen
asleep in some hidden corner.  Behind the couch?  No.  In the attic?
No.  Under his bed?  Nope.  In the loft above the living room?  No
Stinky.<p>

When Stinky's mother counted all his shoes and found none missing, she
really began to worry.  Could he possibly have gone somewhere
barefoot?  When she looked through his clean clothes and dirty
clothes, she found one set of pajamas missing.  Wherever he was,
Stinky was barefooted and in his pajamas!<p>

Sadly, Fern decided to go home.  It seemed useless to keep looking for
Stinky here.  She said goodbye to Stinky's parents, asked them call
her when they found Stinky, and left through the back door.  But as
she walked around the house to the front, she noticed something
strange.  The cellar door was slightly open!  It was usually shut
tight to keep raccoons out.  Aha!  Perhaps that's where Stinky was all
along!  Working on one of his crazy projects, maybe.  Quickly she
opened the cellar door and went down the steps.<p>

In fact, the light was on inside.  But no sign of Stinky.  She called
out his name.  No response.  On top of the work bench was an
unfinished model airplane.  One side was painted bright red with
yellow lettering spelling out "FERN."  What a surprise!  Stinky must
have felt sorry about the fight, too, and was making a present for
her.  Fern was very happy.  But where was he?<p>

She looked around the cellar.  Certainly there was no place for him to
hide.  Everything seemed normal except...something was bugging her.
Something about the washer and dryer that stood across from the work
bench.  What is it?  Only after thinking for a few moments did she
realize what was wrong.  Usually the washer and dryer stood next to
each other.  Now they were a good arm's length apart.  Did something
move them?<p>

As Fern stepped closer, she noticed a small hole in the floor between
the washer and dryer.  It looked like an old drain, but without a
grating.  Then suddenly she saw a small glint in the hole.  She bent
down to see what it was.  It looked like a small metal screw.<p>

It all made sense!  Stinky must have dropped a screw, which rolled
under the dryer.  So he moved the dryer to get it.  But then what
happened?  That was the mysterious part.  As she thought about this
puzzle, Fern reached down to pick up the screw from the hole in the
floor.<p>

This is when things started to go crazy.  As Fern's hand reached down
towards the screw, the hole suddenly seemed to grow bigger and
bigger.  Fern tried to pull back, but it was too late.  The darkness
of the hole spread all around her and she felt herself falling and
falling into the unknown depths.<p>
