<h1>The Executioner</h1>

In a corner of the poorly lit square sits a mutt eyeing the back door
of a restaurant.  It is 9 pm and the endless cycle of expectation and
destitution is beginning again, nourished by the sheltering darkness
and the cool breath of the after-supper hours.  Young lovers entwine
in a shadowy niche near the dog whose attention is expectantly riveted
on that closed door, nose twitching at the wafts of saffron, burnt
cuttlefish, dried rose petals, clove cigarettes, human piss.  Inside
the restaurant sits a solitary customer, his white linen suit tinted
blood-red by the reflected light from the tablecloth, the napkin, the
cracking wall.  He is about to partake of dessert, a custard in a
gourd-sized bowl, its surface glazed with a pane of dark, translucent
caramel.  Mesmerized, he stares at his swarthy reflection in the
dessert.  In the kitchen, the cook gathers the remnants of the night's
victual and scrapes them into a plastic pail that he takes out the
door for the waiting mongrel.  Against the rough stone wall of the
neighboring building the young couple writhes in the throes of a
painful passion.<p>

Out on the boulevard, sidewalk artists chalk their nocturnal creations
under every street lamp, beneath the beckoning gaze of the baby-faced
streetlove artists lined up in front of a shuttered shoe store, fruit
and vegetable stand, a pastry shop, a kiosk.  Many could not possibly
be over sixteen in their miniskirts and stiletto heels, the occasional
customer towering over them in their bulk and wealth, often obviously
a tourist from the richer kingdoms by the colder seas.  The chalk
artists are all men; they probably have daytime jobs that pay.
Theirs, too, is an ephemeral pursuit, the colorful creations on the
concrete pavement erased daily by the shuffle of commuting
patent-leather-clad feet, the traces blurred to the lowest common
denominator, the universal gray.<p>

The man from the restaurant makes his appearance.  He is loping along
the sidewalk at a consciously casual pace, face fixed straight ahead,
eyes unmoved by the insinuations queried by the young girls of the
street.  Curiously, he keeps scratching his hands as if a rash was
starting to grow up from the white crescents of his fingernails, over
the knobs of his wrist bone, the hairy forearms, the sweaty creases on
the inside of his elbows.  He stops and stoops over a depiction of a
volcanic inferno in which scores of people are creatively tortured by
a puppet devil who is manipulated by a pair of mysterious white-gloved
hands suspended in mid-picture.  Moving along this sidewalk gallery
his eyes are caught by the pale, pastel colors of the next exhibit
that are a benign contrast to the screaming flames of the former;
however, a closer inspection reveals the theme of torture also carried
on in this one.  The scene is set against a backdrop of billowy
clouds, a lushly turfed clearing in the woods with carefully detailed
tropical birds hovering here and there.  Handsome men in militaristic
uniforms are hanging young children from a tall tree branch, some with
heavy weights tied to their feet, others with beautifully dripping
stumps where their limbs presumably used to be.  The children are all
Barbie-Dollesque, with pretty, pretty heads and naked, androgynous
bodies.  After a cursory glance the man proceeds quickly, almost
tripping over the artist who is on his hands and knees, to the next
street lamp under which an old man has drawn portraits of passersby
for a small fee.  It is not a large collection; it even appears that
the artist has padded it with renditions of the streetgirls, a sort of
legitimization done perhaps for free, perhaps for certain small favors
to be returned.  The man thinks of the next morning when all these
personalities will be scuffed into oblivion by the single-minded
friction of working feet.  The thought intrigues him in a strange way;
he decides to sit for a portrait.<p>

He squats on the wooden stool that has been provided for him.
Glimpses of his pale belly can be seen between the buttons of his
shirt as his corpulence settles across his spread thighs.  Through the
haze of smoke rising from the old man's insistently glowing cigarette
he scans the faces that drift by.  Minutes pass quietly.  He can sense
his face beginning to form on the pavement.  Then, on a sudden whim,
he takes out his wallet from the inside pocket of his suit and begins
to rifle through the card holder.  After a moment he gingerly slides
out a sepia-toned photograph of a woman.  He hands it over to the old
man, who smiles and nods wordlessly as if acknowledging a familiar
gesture.<p>

When the man in the white linen suit looks down at the completed
portrait, he sees himself and the woman in an old-fashioned cameo,
their demurely smiling gazes slightly downcast and toward each other.
The ambiguous composition suggests either reined in desire or
camouflaged rage.  The result strikes the man as being exactly right,
and he pays the old man double to what they had agreed.  He takes back
the photo of the woman and pauses for a minute to set it on fire with
his lighter.  He lets go of the tiny bonfire just as the flames are
about to reach his fingertips.  It breaks up into glowing fragments,
which then float down to a watery grave in a nearby puddle.  Again the
old man smiles and nods as if witnessing a common ritual.<p>

Down by the docks we see the mutt from the restaurant roaming back and
forth in the scavenger zone between the piers and the warehouses.  The
overwhelming smell here is of the sea and all that wash ashore with
it, the rotting mollusks and seaweed, the sandals and tires, the
inexplicable wicker sofa, as well as the acid stench of a sailor's
drunken vomit rising from a dark corner.  It is now midnight and a
pack of slack-jawed, wolf-eyed dogs is staking its hunting ground.
The solitary mutt hears them approaching and quickly makes an exit
with a paper sack soaked with sausage grease clenched between its
teeth.<p>

Oblivious to the howling of the hounds, we see that our man in the
white linen suit is standing still in the shadow behind a rusting sea
container.  Puffs of cigarette smoke issue from his mouth.  He keeps
glancing at his heavy, golden wristwatch.  Minutes tick past the zero
hour as the quarter moon creeps along its arc above the rim of the
hills.  The dogs move on down the shoreline in search of richer loot,
leaving in their wake an absence of sound except for the periodic,
sibilant murmur of the sea.<p>

Finally, a large, black sedan makes its entrance onto the slimy
concrete stage of the dockyard.  With its headlights off, moonlight
glinting off its impeccable exterior, it glides to a halt as our man
steps out from the shadows.  Three men emerge from a rear door, two
framing the other one as if a pair of orderlies were assisting an
invalid down a hospital corridor.  The human bookends are improbably
identical in their dress and bulky stature, with off-the-rack dark
grey suits and matching pomaded hair.  The "patient" appears to be in
bad shape--a torn T-shirt showing blood-caked cuts on the torso, eyes
half-shut from the dark swells on his face, blood seeping out from
spots like a bruised blackberry.  His yet unfilled-out frame shows him
to be in the early twenties.<p>

After a brief conversation with the man in the white linen suit, the
hulking twins deposit their charge on the ground and retreat to their
vehicle.  The car then rolls back out of the scene.<p>

From a distance the two figures cut a silhouette of a penitent on his
hands and knees asking for absolution from the stern but wise figure
of judgment.  On closer inspection we note that the man on the ground
has soiled his trousers in anticipation of what he knows must come.
The oily nostrils of the man in the white linen suit twitch in
response to the stink of human terror.  As if to mask the smell, he
takes out a cigarette and lights it.  After one brief inhalation he
offers it to the bloody face, which shakes weakly in refusal.<p>

The pistol that is drawn out from the folds of the linen suit is
chrome plated and sleek.  It fits snugly into the hand that bears it
as if it were a natural biological extension.  Its heft is noticeable
as it slowly rises to the level of the kneeling man's head.  The eyes
already swollen half-shut clench tight into wrinkles of flesh.<p>

But instead of the expected blast of nothingness, the doomed man feels
a light tapping on his forehead.  Instinctively he looks up and sees
the gun waving in his face, butt-first.  Dazed by this
incomprehensible reprieve he does nothing until his executioner grabs
his right arm and thrusts the pistol in his hand.  In confusion he
feels the heat of the other man's palm diffusing from the gun handle.
He glances from the weapon to the face of the older man whose eyes are
closed as if in a deep sleep.  The cigarette angles down from his lips
disinterestedly.<p>

Seconds sneak by as the gun is brought down, pointed up, waveringly
held, and brought down again.  There is a choking noise from the young
man's mouth as if he were trying to talk.  Then he tries to get up on
his feet, but tumbles back down in obvious pain.  The gun clatters to
the ground and spins slowly around the safety.<p>

The man in the white linen suit then opens his eyes and stoops, belly
sagging, to pick up the pistol, grunting and losing his cigarette with
the effort.  With a sigh of resignation he snuffs out the smoking butt
with his shoe, steps up in a deliberate stride to the prostrate man,
and shoots one bullet into the back of the skull.  The sharp crack
echoes briefly from the warehouses and flushes out some birds.  The
kinetic odor of gunpowder dissipates in the slight sea breeze as the
blood flows preferentially into the grooves of the concrete.<p>

It is 8 am and the neverending cycle of hope and disillusionment is
beginning again.  A mutt snoozes underneath a sidewalk bench as men in
dark suits and women in office dresses stream past like clockwork
soldiers.  Their smooth-soled shoes pick up dustings of colored chalk
as they unconsciously erase the nighttime illustrations.  Cars and
buses rumble by spewing sooty fumes into the air.  Seated outside a
corner caf&eacute; we see the man in the white linen suit opening a
soft-boiled egg with a butter knife.  He slices off the top and scoops
out the runny yolk with a teaspoon.  As he carries it up toward his
waiting mouth his hand quivers and the viscous fluid dribbles bright
yellow down his immaculate jacket.  A look of absolute despair spreads
across his face.  He buries his greasy head in his arms and starts to
sob like a baby.<p>
