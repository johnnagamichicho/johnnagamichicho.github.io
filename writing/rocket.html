<h1>Rocket Woman in Love</h1>

It was during the fourth viewgraph, the one that showed the flight
trajectory, that I first heard your voice.  I was facing the screen,
tracing the parabolic arc of the payload with the laser pointer, when
I heard from the back of the room, <em>Why did the probe fail to reach
orbit?</em> I replied, without turning around, <em>Catastrophic failure of
the third stage.</em> I was afraid to turn around; I was afraid that our
eyes would meet, phase-lock, and I would instead reply, <em>Because the
desire was not strong enough.</em><p>

But I knew that you would come up to ask me again after the talk.  I
do not believe in fate, as such, but I work in a world where the
inevitable forces that act between bodies determine their paths, where
the stochastic nature of quantum mechanics does not sully the clarity
of the necessary outcome.  The initial conditions were set; I knew you
would come to me.<p>

You were a graduate student: tall, young, and polite.  You praised my
work and said that you referred extensively to my articles in your
first publication (my mischievous mind punned <em>at first cite</em> ).  We
spoke of boundary layers and shock waves.  Of friction loss and
heating.  Of the implications of time-irreversible quantities.  I
asked you out to dinner.<p>

Men usually have confused preconceived notions about me.  A female
rocket scientist: the ultimate case of penis envy.  No, wait--she
wants to have power over the phallus.  Maybe she was abused by her
father.  Or perhaps she just wants to be a man.<p>

But you.  You were different.  You immediately intuited that it was
not a matter of power, of control.  That it had to do with freedom.
Liberation from the gravity that reclaims every pebble thrown and
bends our spirits toward the ground, which keeps us grinding round and
round the same star, in the same hollow in space, keeping us tied to
the lowest common denominator, slowing the expansion of the universe.
I dream of leaving one day, blasting off at escape velocity,
slingshotting away from the ecliptic plane, purely inertial,
force-free.<p>

As we walked down by the piers after dinner, you suddenly took me in
your arms and tossed me with all your strength into the night sky.
For a moment I saw the stars wheeling about me, a sparse world against
my insignificance.  As you caught me in your arms, I glimpsed in your
dark eyes a curious mixture of surprise and sadness, as if you had
half-expected me not to come down, as if you were foreseeing my
departure.<p>

Rockets are still as much an art as a science.  Even a small,
venerable, solid-fuel motor will, on occasion, explode upon ignition,
the shrapnel from the engine casing accelerating outward, lodging
themselves in the concrete blocks of the bunker, punching through the
corrugated metal walls of the hangar, skidding and sparking across the
barren asphalt landscape of the launch area.  Sometimes the explosion
will ignite the second stage and the fin-less payload will execute
several tight loops, all thrust and no control, a fox chasing its tail
on fire, before careering off toward the horizon to land eventually,
perhaps, in a brackish swamp where it will sink, a failure, a curious
artifact for future archeologists.<p>

A rocket engine is a controlled bomb.  And a bomb's greatest desire is
to fulfill the second law of thermodynamics as quickly as possible.
It's our job to channel this adolescent urge for instant gratification
into a more sustained and directionally focused transition to lower
energy states and increased entropy.  Poor little bomb.  Denied its
millisecond of luminous and clamorous glory.<p>

Of course, the analogies to sex are inevitable.  My former lovers
either assiduously ignored that certain words spoken in my presence
had gossamer threads attached that tugged provocatively in different
directions, or they made the threadbare, barefaced pun whenever
possible.  But again, you were different.  Your mind moved from moment
to moment, where each word was defined only in its context,
hermetically sealed for you and me.  For you, a nose cone was a nose
cone was a nose cone.  It's surprising you had survived so long in
this world.  In another place, another time, you would have ended as a
self-immolating monk.<p>

And the other inevitable: The question: Is a rocket launch better than
sex?<p>

The first time we made love.  Two weeks after the conference you came
to see me.  My office.  A cramped little rectangular space with no
exposed wall space--every side lined from floor to ceiling with
journals and books.  File cabinets (which I had painted azure to
brighten the space) glutted with proposals, publication manuscripts,
reviews, and reports.  The steady hum of the tape drive attached to my
workstation.  A framed photo of Challenger taking off on its final
journey.  You locked the door behind you.  Following the line-of-sight
path between our bodies, we accelerated and met in an inelastic
collision on top of the desk, immediately maneuvering to maximize the
contact area.<p>

Afterwards I was mortified to find several exam papers, which I had
neglected to clear off my desk in the urgency of the moment, soaked
with the effluence of our effusion.  I quickly wiped them off with the
handiest piece of cloth (my underwear) and sprinkled them with a
perfume to disguise the scent.<p>

We met as often as our bi-coastal separation would allow.  I
discovered that desire does not fall off with the square of the
distance, neither does it decay exponentially with time.  Longing
across longitudes.  Your absence undermining the horizon.  I slid my
work schedule around the clock so I could call you during waking
hours.<p>

I thought myself the luckiest woman in the world.  Work that I loved,
a man that I loved who wished me absolute freedom.  I even believed
that the tension-and-release cycle of anticipation and fulfillment
forced by our separation was the ideal model for sustaining the wonder
and gratitude that flowed between us.  But eventually, perhaps, we
would move on to another phase.  Home ownership and cohabitation.
Offspring with IQs in the distant outlier of the statistical
distribution.  A mini-van, even.  Or a Volvo station wagon.<p>

One night I dreamed that I had wings of kevlar and feathers made of
mylar.  I flew up through the atmosphere and turned around to gaze in
awe at the blue marble of our planet.  As I headed on toward the sun I
could feel the solar wind caress and heat my face, and my body began
to glow and streams of spark petals were coming off my wings.<p>

Then a comet suddenly blew right past me, sending fireflies of hot
dusty plasma into my burning eyes.  Then I saw you.  You were riding
the comet, your back straight as a seasoned cowboy, heading toward the
sun.  I cried out and tried to beat my wings faster, but they were
unresponsive, as if space had turned into a vast, viscous fluid, and I
was wallowing in its quagmire of despair.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

At times I worried that I was nearly ten years older than you.  That
you might not love me in a decade when I'd turned the corner of
irreversibility (entropy is <em>especially</em> cruel to the skin) while you
were just beginning to fill out in anticipation of the respectable
middle-age male paunch.  My body is not the proverbially shapeless one
of a librarian--men are not solely attracted to me for my beautiful
brain.  I was blessed with the right genes for the paradigm of female
physical beauty that currently prevails in our society, and I've been
careful to preserve my advantages as much as possible.  But the human
body follows, at best, a parabola--you reach a peak, then you start to
fall.  Boltzmann's Arrow of Time hung over my proud body like a
slipping Sword of Damocles--of course, it kills you in the end, but
how much damage will it do and how quickly?<p>

I let slip these fears to you while we drifted in my hot air balloon.
The sinking sun's rays filtered to a bitter orange by the tangential
atmospheric path, the lightly turbulent winds putting a chill to my
shoulders.<p>

You were silent for a while.  Then you bent over and kissed my eyes,
first the self-conscious crow's feet in the corners, then my closed
eyelids, slowly, deliberately.  I watched as the pressure from your
lips conjured golden Rorschach flowers against the deep purple
background, blossoming, then fading as the heat from your mouth also
receded.  <em>I love you now, and it is always now,</em> you said.  My vain
fears were misplaced; it never occurred to me that your time-line
might run out before mine.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

On your last trip to see me, you did not even make it out of town.
The 737 lost power on both engines while climbing at 2500 feet.  The
pilots didn't have a chance.  The stunned silence in the black box
recording, then the despairing expletive.  The aircraft suddenly
ceasing to be a flying object as it slowed to stall speed, then
plunging toward terminal velocity, as airworthy as a penny tossed from
the top of the Empire State Building.<p>

But miraculously your body was recovered unscathed, as if death
overcame you under calmer circumstances: reading the latest issue of
<em>Advances in Space Research</em>, listening to Holst in your favorite
chair, solving time-independent partial differential equations,
playing with your cat, Pynchon, an afternoon nap with your head in my
lap.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Now as I replace the final bolts on this rocket payload, I think about
our first night together when you tossed me up into the night sky.
Your desire and mine.  Now it's your turn.  I've taken out 72 kg of
ballast for you.  Dead weight.  Laugh, my love, I made a joke.<p>

Soon my desire, expressed through this three-stage rocket motor, will
propel you away from me.  When you reach orbital altitude, both you
and the remote sensing satellite will commence the first of your
numerous trips around the Earth, in equilibrium, at last, with the
gravity that took your life.  Your trajectory is programmed on my
computer so that every night I will know exactly when to step out into
the darkness and crane my neck skyward where you will be arcing across
the constellations, a defiant Icarus blazing in the sunlight,
returning again and again to me.<p>
