<h1>To be a Komodo Ranger is not Easy</h1>

<h2>Merpati</h2>

Flight 6558 to Maumere had long ago migrated to the top of the
departure flipboard, but with the qualifying remark of &quot;TECHNICAL&quot;
frozen into the last column, a cryptic explanation for the superseded
departure time, while underneath other flights were flipping their way
up, disappearing with the final boarding call to Kupang, Jakarta,
Bima, Mataram.  I had been forewarned about the unreliability of
Merpati (the largest domestic airline in Indonesia), but better a
delay due to technical problems than a sudden, unscheduled return to
ground due to technical problems.  However, waiting can be a pain
since the airport transit lounge chair is almost universally unkind to
one's butt and back.  It is usually an injection-molded, one-piece
plastic job that terminates exactly at that point where one needs the
most lumbar support.  Soreness lingers in my tactile memory from
far-flung airport interludes in Johannesburg, Moscow, and Fajardo.
Clearly this is a calculated callousness designed to seduce passengers
to the far cushier furniture in the restaurants and bars, where one
can consume, in comfort, a ten-dollar spaghetti marinara or a
three-dollar lite beer (multiply by three for Japan).  The airlines
must be in on it, too, since the only seating possibly less
comfortable than economy-class with their ever-shrinking baselines are
the airport lounge chairs.<p>

After checking with the Merpati agent, who assured me that only a
snack would be served on the Maumere flight, I let myself get sucked
in by the insidious stratagem (and my own appetite) into the
restaurant, where I had the worst <em>nasi campur</em> I would eat on my
entire trip.<p>


<h2><em>Nasi Campur</em></h2>

Literally &quot;mixed rice&quot; in Bahasa Indonesia, <em>nasi campur</em> is a plate
of white rice topped with whatever meat, fish, and vegetables the cook
had made that day, a sort of impromptu version of the Korean <em>bibimbap
</em>.  The concept may be disconcerting to the type of dyspeptic
traveler who demands from McDonald's a strict level of conformity to
the Big Mac recipe whether in Normal, Illinois or Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso (&quot;Jesus.  Will you take a look at this?  They put the Special
Sauce on <em>before</em> the lettuce!&quot;), but a boon for the gastronomically
adventurous but linguistically challenged who only need to memorize
two words to get something different each time when ordering food at a
<em>warung</em>, the Indonesian equivalent of a greasy-spoon diner.  It
usually costs no more than $2 (for your convenience I will quote all
prices in the USD equivalent rather than in rupiahs), but the quality
can vary a great deal.  The version in the restaurant of the Denpasar
domestic terminal was the worst with pieces of rubbery chicken, boiled
liver and onions, boiled egg, and the ubiquitous (but in this instance
stale) <em>krupuk</em>, which are fried chips made of rice flour and fish
flakes.  A spoonful of <em>sambal</em> (hot chili sauce) is always served on
the side to give you control of the spice level.  For the record, the
best <em>nasi campur</em> I had was in Ulu Watu, Bali, where the toppings
were hot and sweet green beans with garlic and ginger, two kinds of
white fish, dark fish, fried salt shrimp, peanuts, roast chicken, and
crisp-fried egg.<p>


<h2>Meet the <em>Mandi</em></h2>

By the time I boarded the airplane, the afternoon sun had heated the
inside of the Fokker F-27 to sauna levels.  The passengers from the
previous stop on this island-hopping flight were already aboard (or
were they on the whole time?), sweat streaming down their somber
faces.  But once we reached cruising altitude, it turned out to be a
smooth turboprop flight, two hours eastward above the north coasts of
Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, and Flores.  We even got a hot lunch (the
Merpati agent was wrong) of rice, fish, cauliflower, and fruit salad.
The aircraft was old but in good shape, although I have to admit that
I needed to kick open the ill-fitting door when exiting the toilet.<p>

After landing in Maumere, I started talking to the other obvious
tourist on the flight, hoping to split the cost of a taxi into town
with him.  Looking in our respective guidebooks, we picked out a
couple of cheap <em>losmen</em>s (inns).  However, we soon learned from the
taxi touts that the majority of the places listed in the books had
been destroyed by the '92 earthquake.  The accompanying tsunami had
also severely damaged the coral reefs for which Maumere was famous, so
I decided to skip the scuba diving I had been planning there.<p>

So, without too much choice, we opted for the Gardena Hotel where we
took a double at $7.50.  After one week at a top-end resort hotel in
Bali, this was my introduction to a <em>losmen</em> room: a concrete box with
peeling walls and a window facing an indoor courtyard, two beds with
pillows and cylindrical cushions the size of a dog (What were they
for?  I never figured it out.) but with no sheets or other bedding, a
light bulb suspended from the ceiling by its own cord, lizards, and
the attached <em>mandi</em>.  Overall pretty much what I had expected, but
the concept of a <em>mandi</em> was new to me and, as it is standard in
Indonesia, merits some description here.<p>

A <em>mandi</em> is the Indonesian bathroom.  It can be indoors, in an
outside shed like an outhouse, or open-air.  It has only two essential
components: a water basin (a concrete or ceramic-tiled rectangular
reservoir the size of a small refrigerator laid supine on the floor)
and a ceramic squat toilet.  And, of course, the all-important
large-plastic-cup-with-handle.  It is a simple, elegant system.  You
squat, shit, wash yourself with a cupful of water (left hand only,
please), then flush with a couple more cups.  To bathe, just dump some
water on yourself with the cup, lather up, then rinse off.  There is a
drain on the floor so the entire area is used for bathing.  For
maintenance one just scrubs down the floor and refills the basin.<p>


<h2>Saturday Night, Maumere</h2>

Maumere (&quot;big beach&quot;), located on the northeastern coast of Flores, is
the most accessible town on the island by air (i.e., more than one
flight per day to the other islands).  Historically, it was one of the
most important bases for Portuguese Catholic missionaries, and eastern
Flores remains predominantly Catholic (albeit a syncretic form infused
with older animistic beliefs), an anomaly in Indonesia, the most
populous Muslim country in the world.  The typical small-town
Indonesian knows exactly three phrases in English: &quot;Hello,
Mistah/Missus,&quot; &quot;Where you from?&quot; and &quot;Where you going?&quot;  I had
thought at first that these were the phrases they learned first in
English class at school, but it turns out that the &quot;where from/where
to&quot; questions are ones that they ask each other in normal encounters,
analogous to our &quot;How are you?&quot;.  So they are merely translating their
own greeting ritual into English.  Perhaps as a self-conscious
recognition of their distinct religious identity (pride or
insecurity?), the Florinese often add another query, &quot;Religion?&quot;.
They become more animated if you answer that you are Catholic, and
will tell you their Christian names and boast that the Pope once
visited Maumere, a dusty little port town of 40,000 people.<p>

At night, Dario (the Italian-Swiss, dental equipment service
technician I met at the airport) and I walked the dark, unpaved roads
(Maumere had electricity, but little of it was wasted on street
lighting) into the center of town to find food and, perhaps,
entertainment as it was Saturday night.  We found a <em>warung</em> where we
had good beef <em>sate</em> and <em>mie goreng</em> (fried noodles).  We also
attracted a number of idle youths who wanted to practice their
English.  We tried to find out if there were any live bands or dance
clubs, but from what we could make out, we were already sitting in the
most happening place in town with a karaoke machine in the bar.  Soon,
the machine was cranked up and a Rhoma Irama-wannabe began blustering
his way through a <em>dangdut</em> refrain.  We quickly paid our bill and
left.<p>

Back at the Gardena, the concrete pillbox of a room was at body
temperature with no air motion, the TV in the common area was blasting
out sounds from a variety show, the mosquitos were starving, and Dario
began to snore as soon as he hit his bed.  Resolutely, I smeared DEET
all over my body, inserted earplugs (souvenir from a Strategic Air
Command flight I once took to Greenland), and closed my eyes.<p>


<h2>Zen and Rapture on Public Transport</h2>

The material infrastructure may be wanting at times, but the level of
human service is always high in Indonesia.  In the morning, the hotel
manager made a phone call and arranged for a <em>bemo</em> to take us to the
bus terminal.  A <em>bemo</em> is a short-distance (intratown or
intervillage) shared transport, usually a small truck or van, with the
following defining characteristics: It has at least one teenage tout
boy along with the driver, it has a name (and sometimes a motto)
painted on its side, and, most importantly, it has a sound system
booming out the latest cassette recordings (usually bootleg).  As we
rode through the town center (a vacant lot where the market, destroyed
by the earthquake, used to be), I observed the to-ing and fro-ing of
the other <em>bemo</em>s, each one gussied up according to the owner's
tastes--multi-colored flashing lights above the windshield, fancy
chrome wheels, chintz hangings in the windows, a plastic Virgin icon
swinging from the rear-view mirror, an &quot;I {heart} my Toyota&quot; bumper
sticker.  The flavor of their names were straight-ahead macho
(&quot;Casanova,&quot; &quot;Texas Cowboy,&quot; &quot;Al Pacino&quot;--about half of them were in
English), while the mottos appeared to incline more towards romance
(&quot;Full time for love,&quot; &quot;Woman in love&quot;).  Perhaps I wasn't yet
culturally &quot;in&quot; enough to pick up on the subtler nuances, but these
public declarations on the <em>bemo</em>s seemed much simpler and more
literal than the sly, oblique mottos of West African lorries (&quot;No
condition is permanent,&quot; &quot;To be a man is not easy,&quot; &quot;God bless
Allah&quot;).  Perhaps strict government censorship extended to <em>bemo</em>
mottos as well.<p>

Once at the terminal, the <em>bemo</em> took us straight to a bus bound for
Ende (the direction we wanted to go), dropped us off, and left.  No
charge.  Apparently it was a &quot;feeder&quot; <em>bemo</em> for the long-distance
bus; the touts from the other Ende buses only half-heartedly tried for
our patronage.  Mitsubishi must be making a killing in Indonesia--90%
of the buses I saw were Colt Diesels with their retro-modern,
bullet-train-like front ends.<p>

Unfortunately we were seated at the rear end of the bus, since the
rest of the seats were already taken.  Even so it took a long time to
actually leave Maumere, as the air tank needed to be filled at the
garage (with a valve blowing out on the first try) and more people had
to be picked up at their homes.  Meanwhile the driver had put on a
cassette for our pleasure, and the first song that came on was
&quot;Country Road.&quot;  Because I had heard this song played more than once
by the house band at the Bali Cliff Resort (you couldn't get away from
those guys: No matter where you decided to eat dinner (the Cliff Cafe,
the Ocean Restaurant, the Ela Ela Lounge) they would show up like a
guitar popping up out of nowhere in an Elvis movie and serenade you
with the likes of &quot;Hey, Jude&quot; or something by The Carpenters), I began
to think of &quot;Country Road&quot; as my theme song for this trip.
Incongruous but appropriate, I thought.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Flores is a long, thin island running east-west for 230 miles.  The
Trans-Flores Highway runs more-or-less east-west for 440 miles.  More
than half of it is paved and some sections actually have a painted
divider line, but seldom is its width more than that of one Winnebago.
And I would estimate that, on the average, it has a curve every 100
feet.  Furthermore, people drive with the firm conviction that
anything alive will move out of the way.  The saving grace in Flores
is the lack of traffic.  Only a handful of people are rich enough to
own cars, so all you encounter are transport trucks and buses every 15
minutes or so.<p>

As the bus moved westward from Maumere, it made frequent stops to let
off and take on passengers.  Never say no to a ride, must be the
motto.  Eventually we had passengers sitting in the aisle and the tout
boys hanging out the open doors, Douglas Fairbanks-style.  Then the
frequent turns started to get to some of the passengers.  First it was
the little boy sitting at my feet.  Fortunately, he already had one of
the small plastic bags that were being passed around, and he hardly
made a sound.  But soon after we all heard a painful
&quot;UWWRRAAARRUGGHHHH!&quot; from a woman sitting several rows forward.  To
make matters worse, people around me began to light up cigarettes to
either calm their gullets or to mask that characteristic sour stench
of vomit that was starting to waft back to us.  I tried focusing my
eyes out the window and meditating on nothingness, on the &quot;uncarved
block,&quot; but the unwanted sensory stimuli were seeping into my mind.<p>

I decided the best course of action was to stand up and hang out the
open door with the touts.  MUCH better.  Fresh air, better views, a
heightened sense of motion.  Then we stopped to pick up more
passengers.  I was beginning to feel crowded out.  Then, as the bus
took off, I noticed one of the touts climbing on top of the bus.  What
a great idea!  Feeling like Indiana Jones, I stretched my right arm
around the rear corner of the bus, grabbed a part of the steel lattice
that was connected to the roof-top luggage rack, swung myself around
to the rear end, climbed up the lattice, then crawled over the luggage
pile to the front of the roof.  There I seated myself next to the tout
boy, hanging on tightly to the luggage rack behind me.  Best seat on
the bus!  Panoramic views of the V-shaped valleys and velvet-green
volcanic peaks that form the backbone of Flores, corn fields and
iridescent-green terraced rice paddies, bare-foot farmers leading
water buffaloes around palm-fringed mud plots to soften the ground for
planting, children standing back from the road waving animatedly to
the crazy tourist on top of the bus, and surprise vistas of the Indian
Ocean at hairpin bends.  The road was so narrow that often I could not
see its edge but would be looking straight down a precipice, at the
bottom of which would be a white ribbon of water.  The only things I
had to watch out for were tree branches low enough to knock back my
coconut and my linear momentum threatening to fling me off at every
sharp turn.<p>

For two hours I stayed on top until a bus driver coming from the other
direction stopped and warned us that cops were ahead.  Grudgingly we
climbed back inside for the rest of the trip to Moni.<p>


<h2>ABBA and Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten</h2>

At the suggestion of one of the locals in Maumere, Dario and I (we had
sort of become traveling companions since we were going in the same
direction) headed for the Original Homestay in Moni.  Even though it
is a small village, Moni boasts many <em>losmen</em>s due to its proximity to
Flores's premier tourist attraction, Keli Mutu, the caldera with three
lakes of different color.  The plan was to stay here overnight and to
take the pre-dawn truck ride up the mountain for the classic sunrise
view of the lakes.<p>

One of the great pleasures of low-budget travel is the ease with which
one meets other travelers.  Most of the travelers I met in Flores were
young backpackers in it for the long haul, many who were &quot;doing&quot;
Australia, southeast Asia, and perhaps India over the span of a year
or more.  Others were older working people from Europe taking their
annual six-week vacation just in Nusa Tenggara (the string of
Indonesian islands east of Bali of which Flores was one).  They were
incredulous to learn that most American jobs started with two weeks of
vacation per year and that I was lucky to get 4.5 weeks per year.
They could not understand how Americans could put up with such a
grueling lifestyle.<p>

Original Homestay was a big German hangout, partly because the
manager, Chris, was a German who also doubled as the village
physician.  The other lodgers were: Dieter and Kuni, the gung-ho
Bayern boys who kept eating cloves of raw garlic, claiming they were
the best mosquito repellent (a much more effective people repellent, I
said); Elke and J&uuml;rgen, the flaky, beauty-and-the-beast couple who
had no agenda but to tag along with whatever plans others made;
Jacqueline, a German-Swiss who had hit the motivational doldrums and
had been hanging out at Original for three weeks doing nothing; and
Nicole, once a cog in the corporate machine, who quit her job in a
dramatic take-this-job-and-shove-it confrontation (her co-workers,
hearing her screaming diatribe leaking out of the boss's office, gave
her an ovation when she emerged 2.5 hours later); now she finances her
trips by importing arts and crafts.<p>

When communicating with people from other countries, it's important
to find an area of common experience in order to establish a feeling
of connectedness.  With young people popular music is always a good
bet.  When Kuni confessed to having a particular fondness for ABBA and
the BeeGees, we were all over him, an international show of solidarity
against bad taste.  Nicole then related the nauseous tale of being
trapped on the 11-hour bus ride from Labuan Bajo to Bajawa with one
Bryan Adams cassette, repeated over and over.  I left Elke in a haze
of German nostalgia when I talked about Nina Hagen and Einst&uuml;rzende
Neubauten.  Dario liked Tom Waits.  J&uuml;rgen broke out into the German
version of &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.&quot;  The global
reach of pop music.  The kitsch and the cool.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

When my alarm went off at 3:30 am, the roar of rain on the zinc-pan
roof told me that there would be no truck ride to Keli Mutu that
morning.  When I awoke again at 8, Chris told me that it was only the
second time in the past half year that it had rained like that in the
early morning.  Actually, the weather was still bad.  The lakes would
probably not be visible even if I hiked up during the day.  So.  I
would stay another day.  I was not going to leave without seeing the
lakes.<p>


<h2>One for the NSF Geosciences Directorate</h2>

After a lazy day of strolling around nearby villages between rains
(and buying a pair of flip-flops at the market for 50 cents), I went
to bed with the alarm set again at 3:30 am.<p>

When the alarm went off I could hear the rain on the roof again.
Shit!  How could I be so unlucky?  Disgusted, I went right back to
sleep.<p>

At 4:00 am, a banging on my door.  It's Ambros, the owner's son.  &quot;The
truck is here.&quot;  WHAT?  Quickly I wriggle into my clothes and insert
contacts into my protesting eyes.  The rain had stopped and, once
outside, I could see stars in the sky.<p>

It takes the truck 1.5 hours to rumble up the bad, 9-mile dirt road,
slick from the rains, to the 5300-ft summit.  Once on top, it's
already light enough to see the lakes--two side-by-side in the east
and the other in the west, each in a volcanic cone.  They are all
more-or-less circular and similar in size, maybe 500 feet in diameter.
The western lake is soy-sauce colored, while the eastern ones are dark
emerald and milky lime with curry foam around the edge.  The latter
two have convective spots on the surface.  The truly strange thing is
that the colors have changed over the years.  Photographs from the
'70s show that the lakes were red, white, and blue.  No one has a
quantitative explanation.  Someone ought to write a proposal to find
out exactly what is going on here.<p>

Sadly, we never did get our Keli Mutu sunrise that morning, as
low-level clouds in the east developed and rose faster than the sun.
But the lakes and the panoramic contextualization of Flores as a
narrow-waisted ocean island were well worth the $1.50 I paid for the
truck ride.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Instead of riding down with the truck, Dario and I decided to hike
back.  And despite the story we had just heard of the Dutch tourist
who wandered off from the summit three weeks ago and was never seen
again, we veered off on an unmarked foot path at the first
opportunity.  Unlike the road, the path descended steeply, eschewing
switchbacks in favor of the fall line, and we had to step carefully on
the slippery soil.  In the woods, I could differentiate at least a
half-dozen different bird songs--enough material for a Messiaen
symphony.  Out in the open, hawks circled overhead.  Judging from the
direction of the sun, we appeared to be angling further south toward
the ocean than we wanted.  Into the woods again.  With descending
altitude and rising sun, it was growing hotter.  We kept expecting the
path to change direction or to bifurcate, but neither happened.  Then
suddenly we came upon a clearing in which there was a little house.<p>


<h2>The Ever-Shrinking Global Village</h2>

Young children playing.  When they see us, they call out in greeting
and quickly fetch their mother from inside.  The mother courteously
beckons us to sit down and rest.  We thank her and seat ourselves on
the bamboo-slat deck.  Amazing how obvious the human gestures are even
though we know only a few Bahasa Indonesian phrases.  It's also
remarkable that Bahasa Indonesia is known in the most rural places;
the Indonesian government has been very successful in spreading the
use of Bahasa Indonesia (a language similar to Malay and one that has
been used as a trade language here for centuries) as the official
language, a crucial factor in maintaining any semblance of national
unity in a country with over 300 ethnic languages.<p>

By this time, six children have come out to examine us more closely.
Two of the girls are identical twins.  One goes back in to brew tea,
and the other goes out to pluck some fruit.  Thus, we are served hot
tea and a plate of passion fruit and guava, split and peeled by one of
the twins (the one with a miniature Canadian flag pin on her shirt).
&quot;Canadian?&quot; I ask her.  She nods her head, &quot;Canada.&quot;  There is also a
weathered, 3x5 photo tacked to the door jamb; it shows a young,
saronged white man and an old Indonesian man posing together in front
of this house.  Travelers descending from Keli Mutu must occasionally
wander off the main road like we just did.  Just then the old man in
the photo steps out through the door.  I greet him and point to the
photo.  &quot;Australian,&quot; he says.  The bamboo wall of the hut is further
brightened by plastered monthly calendars from 1994, each one with a
photo of a sports car and a scantily clad woman.  The cultural
semiotics become even more confusing as a young man appears out of the
bush carrying a bow and arrows with crude but mean-looking iron tips,
then squats in the traditional resting stance and lights up a Marlboro
Light.  He tells us he was hunting for wild pigs.<p>

Now it was time to show off for the visitors.  The oldest daughter
goes over to the loom and begins weaving <em>ikat</em>, the traditional cloth
in Nusa Tenggara, where the warp is dyed with the desired pattern
before the woof is woven in.  The youngest boy eagerly demonstrates a
rubber band trick where the band is shot with a backward spin such
that it rolls back towards the shooter once it hits the ground.  If he
figured that out himself, he has a pretty good intuition for physics
already.  The &quot;Canadian&quot; twin splits more passion fruits.<p>

We had no appropriate souvenir for the family (Dario tried to give
away a small bottle of mosquito repellent, but it was handed back by
the tea-serving twin with a blank smile), so we left some money for
the tea and fruits (50 cents), relying on my Lonely Planet guidebook
that suggested this was appropriate behavior.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

After we left the little house there were many forks in the path.  We
did get a bit lost, but with the helpful hand gestures from the people
we met (EVERYBODY knew where Meestah Krees, the doctor, lived), we
arrived safely at the Original Homestay by lunch time.<p>


<h2>Bool Sheet</h2>

Next day, the entire contingent at Original left together on the
morning truck to Ende (except for Dieter who had left earlier).  And
the first song to be played through the truly boss sound system?
&quot;Country Road.&quot;  Oh, but mama, was I a long way from West Virginia.<p>

It was a slow ride.  (Nicole had insisted on a truck rather than a bus
as the more fun way to go, but I think she was just paranoid of being
trapped in a closed space with a Bryan Adams tape again.)  Not that we
were in a hurry to go anywhere.  But Dario was uncharacteristically in
an irritable mood and every time we stopped to pick up passengers he
emitted an exasperated &quot;Bool sheet.&quot;  Every time a bus overtook and
passed us, &quot;Bool sheet.&quot;  Tottering over a dubious two-plank wooden
bridge, &quot;Bool sheet!&quot;  As huge sacks of cocoa were pushed in under our
benches so that we to sit with our knees against our chests, &quot;BOOL
sheet!&quot;  Finally, spotting another passenger truck that had two water
buffaloes, head-to-tail, crammed in with the people, &quot;BOOL SHEET!!&quot;
Literally.  He was in a better mood after that.<p>

After a goat-soup lunch in Ende, we said good bye to Nicole and
Jacqueline, who were taking a ship to Lombok.  The rest of us
continued westward on a bus to Bajawa, dodging boulders the size of VW
Beetles, skirting the jagged edge of washed-out asphalt (road workers
were everywhere; if they ever went on strike, the Trans-Flores would
become impassable in a couple of days), the route snaking around
volcanoes (one active, emitting copious steam), climbing up to the
interior highlands.<p>


<h2>Of Bad Drinks, Big Rocks, and Rain in Ruteng</h2>

At 3700 feet above sea level, Bajawa (pop. 10,000) is cool.  Taking
that cold-water bath in the <em>mandi</em> becomes an ordeal.  It is also
scenically set in a ring of volcanoes, of which the 7500-ft Gunung
Inerie in the south is king.  And there is more money here than in the
larger Maumere as is apparent in the better building materials and the
larger, better-stocked stores.  Also, more ethnic Chinese business
owners.  There is one general store that sells everything from TVs to
guitars to pellet guns (well, okay, there was one guitar (&quot;Yamaha
style,&quot; the label read) and one gun).  There are at least three
photocopy centers.  (This was also a peculiarity of Indonesia: I'm not
surprised to see a satellite dish in a small village, but every small
hamlet along the main highway had a Selex photocopy shop.  Is there so
much bureaucratic paper work here?)  There is even a Merpati office,
so I go in to see if I could book a ticket from Labuan Bajo to
Denpasar.  One man and one empty desk, no phone in sight.  The only
customers are large packages addressed to Kupang, Bima, Mataram.  No
can do.  He only sells Bajawa tickets.  Will have to buy in Labuan
Bajo.  But could I make a reservation?  Sorry, radio broken.<p>

For dinner I have noodle soup and tempeh with peanut sauce.  Out of
curiosity, Elke, Kuni, and I buy a bottle of Anggur Putih (&quot;white
wine&quot;), a 36-proof, clear liquid with a suggestive picture of grapes
on the label.  And it tastes just like...Inca Cola!  That same
insidious bubble gum flavor!  Is Indonesia covertly exporting arms to
Peru in exchange for flavored-drink technology?  A coke-and-dagger
deal?<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

5 am at the Sunflower Hotel: Awakened by church bells AND a muezzin's
call to prayer.  The further west we go, the more mosques there are.
I reach for the earplugs to try for a couple more hours of sleep.<p>

At 8 am, Dario and I are in the central market waiting for Wildo, who
was recommended to us by other travelers as a guide to the traditional
Ngada villages in the Bajawa area.  He shows up promptly in jeans, a
hand-painted jacket (English song lyrics on the back), and a
Walkman-clone, a hip Bajawan in his early twenties.  We set out in a
<em>bemo</em> to the first village, Wogo.<p>

About 20 minutes east of Bajawa and a short walk off the main road, we
enter a rectangular dirt space about the size of two football fields
laid end-to-end surrounded by thatched-roof, bamboo-frame huts.  Each
house is set off the ground on stilts, with a covered porch extended
out in front.  The village is mostly empty except for young children
and geriatric folks.  The others must be out working or at school.
Some of the children are completely naked and all are quite dirty from
running around outside, snot running from their noses, with knotty,
ragged hair.  A few distended bellies, but overall they seem pretty
healthy.  Also, this village is close enough to the main road to have
electricity.  I don't see any satellite dishes, but I wonder if the
chief's house, at least, has a TV.<p>

In the middle of the field are three rows of objects, each row
consisting of seven of the same class of items.  The object in the
first row is a stone pole, about 2 feet high.  In the second row is
something that looks like a beach parasol, about 8 feet high, with a
steep, thatched top; at its apex is a little, straw man holding a
spear in each arm.  The final row has a scale model of a village hut,
about 5 feet high.<p>

Wildo explains that the stone phallus (<em>peo</em>) represents the
father (god), the parasol (<em>ngadhu</em>) symbolizes the son (man),
and the doll house (<em>bhaga</em>) refers to the wife (woman).  There
are seven each in this village, because each family group has its own
<em>peo</em>, <em>ngadhu</em>, and <em>bhaga</em>.  When the annual
water buffalo sacrifice is made, it must be killed by the <em>kepala
suku</em> (village chief) with a special ceremonial knife in front of
the <em>bhaga</em> with the animal tethered to the <em>peo</em>
through a hole in the <em>ngadhu</em>.  Then the <em>kepala suku</em>
slices open the buffalo heart to read the future of the village.
Actually, Wildo adds, the ceremonial knife is too old and dull to kill
the buffalo, so the chief only gives a light tap with it, then
switches to an ordinary cutlass to lop off the head.  Wildo's father
is a <em>kepala suku</em>, and some day Wildo will take his place.<p>

A short walk through a foggy bamboo forest brings us to the site of
Old Wogo where the ancestral megaliths (basically piles of large rock
shards) of the current village still reside, one for each family
group.  For the Ngada, the family megalith provides an unmoving
reference point from which to draw a sense of identity and belonging
even if one moves away to a distant city.  Exactly the kind of thing
for which many rootless Americans yearn.  Perhaps there is money to be
made here: &quot;Membership in a family megalith for only $500!  For $1000
you can become a certified <em>kepala suku</em>!  Special ceremonial knife
included, plus a giant Ginsu cleaver for that hard-to-hack-off buffalo
head!  Sacrificial water buffalo available for an additional shipping
fee inside the continental states!  Call this toll-free number now!&quot;<p>

Early next morning we boarded the &quot;super express&quot; bus to Labuan Bajo,
which even had reserved seating at the normal fare of $5.  Not only
was the first song NOT &quot;Country Road,&quot; it was not even the dreaded
Bryan Adams that Nicole had warned us about.  Instead we were treated
to some interesting Indonesian rock music (FYI: the group was Sawung
Jabo and the album was <em>Sirkus Barock</em>).  There was a sinking
feeling in my stomach when the infamous Bryan Adams tape was played
next, but Allah was merciful and did not let the driver play it more
than twice.<p>

Despite some setbacks (a bad tire, which was changed during the lunch
stop, and a torrential downpour in Ruteng that prompted the driver to
provide door-to-door service (the market and roadside stores were
flooded, pigs were wallowing happily in the overflowing ditches)) we
roared down toward Labuan Bajo well within the standard 11-hour travel
time, tires squealing around the last hairpin bends as the amber rays
from the setting sun grazed and glinted off the stuccoed waters of the
Komodo Islands.<p>


<h2>Slow Boat to Rinca</h2>

End of the road: On the northwest tip of Flores, Labuan Bajo
(pop. 2000) is a one-strip fishing village, used by travelers as the
ocean gateway to the Komodo Islands.  Literally &quot;bay of the Bajo,&quot; an
ethnic group known historically for their nomadic fishing lifestyle (a
Bajo was said to have been born, married, and died on a boat), the
town is now also populated by the Manggarai from inland Flores and the
Bugi from Sulawesi.<p>

Together with Sabine and Silke, social workers from Hamburg whom we
met on the bus, Dario and I arranged for a two-day boat trip to Rinca,
the smaller and wilder of the two main islands in the Komodo National
Park.  We then hiked up to the Merpati office where the women and I
bought tickets to Denpasar for Thursday, the day before I was
scheduled to fly out of the country.<p>

Next morning the four of us put out to sea on a putt-putt wooden boat,
about 40 feet in length, with a small cabin in the back for the crew
of two, and an open-air, canopied deck in front for the passengers.
The diesel motor spewed a lot of smoke and was very slow, but the boat
was roomy and comfortable.  The captain and his mate looked like
teenage boys (age estimation of the Florinese is difficult; their
faces mature early but do not change much with age) and didn't speak
any English, but fortunately Sabine, a veteran Indonesian traveler,
was fairly conversant in Bahasa Indonesia.  In any case, the term
&quot;<em>bagus</em>&quot; (the Indonesian equivalent of
&quot;cool&quot;) went a long way in generating good will, so Dario
and I used it indiscriminately in that buffoonish way for which
tourists are not penalized.<p>

The sea was remarkably calm.  We could see convective clouds beginning
to form over inland Flores (probably over Ruteng), but the sky above
us remained clear and bright.  Later in the morning we anchored off of
Bidadar Island for some snorkeling.  VERY warm water--warmer than
in the Caribbean.  Other observations: A large variety of soft
coral, an abundance of giant clams and giant starfish (both brilliant
blue), damselfish, angelfish, lots of tuna, and a huge orange worm
that looked like it was built from an erector set.  The sand on the
beach was white with flecks of red mixed in like maraschino cherry
minced into vanilla ice cream.  Looked at from a distance the sand had
a pinkish hue.<p>

While we were swimming, the crew had prepared our lunch: fried fish,
eggplant with peanut sauce, fried noodles with green beans, cucumber
florets, rice, and <em>krupuk</em>.  Simple but tasty.  The $25 for
the two-day trip, which seemed a bit steep at first (in Indonesian
terms), was starting to seem like a good deal.  After we finished
eating, the boat started off again as we sipped our post-meal tea.<p>

The narrow channels around the Komodos are notorious for their vicious
currents and whirlpools.  Twenty to thirty divers in the pearl farms
around Rinca die each year, swept away by the underwater rapids.  At
times we could feel the boat being tugged this way and that like a car
with bald tires fish-tailing on patches of black ice.  I had still
been considering arranging for a scuba trip around these islands, but
I decided then that there was no need to push the agenda, especially
with the lack of proper facilities in Labuan Bajo.<p>

Our next stop was alongside a small, mangrove-covered island, right
across from an even smaller, rocky island (about 500 feet in diameter)
where three huts stood side-by-side along the sloping shore.  We could
make out several little children playing on the beach.  I wondered
where they got their fresh water--the island was too small to have its
own supply.  They must ship in tanks from Labuan Bajo.  The Bajo may
have settled down, but some, apparently, have not given up on the sea
as a way of life.<p>

It was close to dusk, and the crew began to cook dinner.  The four of
us dived off the boat to cool off, but the current was too strong for
comfort; we had to keep swimming to stay in place.  Back on board, as
we started on our dinner, the captain called and pointed above the
mangrove island.  The first &quot;flying foxes&quot; (large fruit bats) were
beginning their daily trip towards Flores in search of food.
Silhouetted against a luminously orange western sky, they kept
streaming out in an orderly, single-minded fashion, flapping their
classic, Batman-logo wings at a leisurely twice-per-second rate with
their opaque &quot;arms,&quot; looking exactly like large rats powering
themselves along on primitive flying contraptions.  Occasionally a
non-conformist would take an off-ramp from the highway in the sky and
dip down to the water, coasting just above the calm surface.  The bat
flux continued unabated for at least twenty minutes as the sun set
with the rapidity characteristic of the equatorial latitudes.  The
mangrove island must harbor many tens of thousands of bats.  Why they
had colonized this particular island when they had to travel so far
every day for food was as mysterious to me as why some Bajos settled
on waterless islands the size of a suburban back yard.<p>

Under a moonless and cloudless sky we chugged on toward Rinca.  The
Southern Cross gave us a sense of direction as we wound around dark
isles.  Dinoflagellates were abundant in the water and we stuck our
feet in the water to produce more of the phosphorescence.  Eventually
we dropped anchor in a cove where everything was absolutely calm--no
waves, no breeze, no mosquitos, no fishing boats.  Only the jumping
fish broke the stillness (as they had been all day--I had never been
in waters so full of jumping fish).  We laid down thin mattresses on
the deck as the crew climbed on top of the cabin to sleep.  The
current flowing past the taut anchor line streamed off fireflies of
phosphorescence, as if the rope was a slow fuse burning with a cold,
blue fire.  The four of us lay down side-by-side and declared that the
first one to fall asleep would be used as dragon bait in the morning.<p>


<h2>To be a Komodo Ranger is not Easy</h2>

Soon after a fried-banana breakfast, we landed at Loh Buaya, the main
ranger station on Rinca.  Not five minutes after landing we spotted
our first Komodo dragon (<em>varanus komodoensis</em>, the world's largest
lizard).  This one was somewhat smaller than me.  Locally known as the
<em>ora</em>, about 2000 live on the main island of Komodo and about 600 on
Rinca.  They are, of course, protected by the national park service
and have become, in recent years, quite a tourist attraction.  For
President Suharto's visit to Komodo in 1988, the government built a
heli-pad and a grandstand where the old man watched as a strung-up
goat was devoured by the giant lizards.  For a while this feeding show
was continued twice a week for tourists, but it has now been
discontinued.  On Rinca there are fewer visitors (we were the only
ones there that day), and we were pointedly warned of past tourists
who, wandering out of the station without a guide, were never seen
again.  The <em>ora</em> usually do not attack people, but given the
opportunity they certainly will eat us, so the National Park strictly
forbids hiking without an official guide.<p>

After signing in at the post, Dario and I left for a 3-mile hike with
the ranger (Sabine and Silke, unfortunately, only had flip-flops).
Early morning, and it was already hot.  The ranger said that it got up
to 45 deg C in the height of the dry season.  Dragon weather--they
loved the heat and were most active in hunting at mid-day.  The
vegetation was a big change from Flores--mostly savannah with a few
trees and lots of cacti.  A large herd of crab-eating macaques loped
across our trail.  A wild horse, a deer, wild pigs.  A sweeping
panorama of the Komodos from a hilltop (&quot;That's a Japanese pearl farm
down there&quot;), but no dragons.<p>

On the way back, the ranger told us of the Sumbawan poachers that
openly landed on Rinca and shot at park rangers who tried to
intervene.  When he said &quot;poachers&quot; I immediately thought of the
movie, <em>The Freshman</em>, in which the plot revolves around a dastardly
dining club that meets to eat only endangered species, in this case a
Komodo dragon, but the ranger was talking about illegal deer hunting.
He said a colleague lost an ear last year to a poacher's bullet, and
lamented that they were not allowed to carry guns themselves.  He
admired the wildlife administration in Kenya where rangers had
permission to shoot-to-kill elephant poachers.  &quot;Here, we can only
call the police from Labuan Bajo.  And when they show up...&quot;  He
rubbed his fingers together to imply that all they do is take bribes
from the Sumbawans.  From everything I heard about the Indonesian
government, this was business as usual.<p>

Back at the station we were greeted by a smiling Sabine and Silke, who
were now virtually surrounded by dragons.  &quot;They came to us!&quot;  We had
to admit that we did not see a single one on our hike.  Laughing at
our sweat-darkened shirts, they bought us warm Cokes.  The five
lizards were of all different sizes, from a foot-long baby to a 7-foot
adult, which the ranger estimated to be about 8 years old.  They
looked pretty cute to me.  Just big lizards.  Well, okay, the teeth
and claws looked kind of nasty, but they acted so benignly.  Only when
one whacked another with its tail (in play, I presume) did I get a
sense of their power.  I wanted to see one swallow a poacher whole.<p>


<h2>Lazy Days at Waecicu</h2>

With stops for more snorkeling and dolphin-watching, we putt-putted
back toward Flores, and were finally dropped off at Waecicu Beach,
twenty minutes north of Labuan Bajo.  There, one could stay in a
beach-front, bamboo bungalow and be fed three meals for $5 a day.  The
women and I had a few days to while away before our Merpati flight, so
we figured it would be a nice enough place to hang out.  Dario, on the
other hand, was leaving the next morning on a 5-day boat trip to
Lombok.  Three of the Germans from Moni were already there: Kuni, with
his ever-ready machete against poisonous snakes falling from tree
branches (&quot;Hey, no joke, I killed a scorpion yesterday&quot;), Elke, with
her diamond-studded nose and a copy of Anais Nin, and J&uuml;rgen, with
his scruffy beard and saronged beer belly.  Elke and J&uuml;rgen, upon
hearing Dario's plan, decided to go with him on the boat.<p>

Waecicu reminded me of summer camp.  The call to meals (with a bamboo
knocker), the shared dining arrangement, the smell of mosquito coils
burning under the table, the campers playing badminton, writing
postcards, and swapping stories, and the staff singing around a guitar
at night.  Even though it was on Flores proper, it was isolated from
Labuan Bajo due to a lack of roads--one had to take a boat to go to
town.  So even though it was low budget, Waecicu was a real
&quot;resort&quot;--one where backpackers could spend a few days off the road
and relax on the beach without having anyone come up to ask &quot;Hey,
Mister!  Where you from?  Where you going?&quot;<p>

Waecicu also had three entertaining characters.  Ahim, who was in
charge while the boss was gone, loved to sit and chat with the
travelers, apologizing profusely for his &quot;green&quot; English, but
nevertheless keeping Sabine and I especially amused with his unique
turns of phrase.  Chain-smoking his way through a pack of Garams
(Indonesian clove cigarettes), everything was bloody this, bloody
that.  &quot;Stress&quot; was also a big word: he was stressed because there was
too much work, the monkey was stressed because it was raining, the
shuttlecock was stressed because you slammed it too hard.  And
anything that did not work had a broken heart: &quot;Ahim, what's wrong
with the boat?&quot; &quot;Oh, broken heart.  Too much stress.&quot;  Hell, all that
smoking was sure to put him in acute financial stress AND give him one
bloody, broken heart one of these days.  Even though a pack only cost
50 cents, at a pack a day that still ate up 3/5th of his fixed salary.
But this predicament seemed typical of the Indonesian man.  (Women, on
the other hand, were fond of betel nuts, which were much cheaper
but gave them messy, red teeth.)<p>

Oni, the eight-year-old son of the owner, was also a smoker already.
Knowing that the boss would not be happy, Ahim allowed him to smoke at
will, laughing at the novelty of an eight year old smoking.  Oni was
also the fattest child I saw in Indonesia.  He would start banging the
bamboo knocker at odd hours demanding to be fed immediately.  Ahim
would then point to him and remark, &quot;Big boss stress.&quot;  Oni and Ahim
were continuously roughhousing and it was hard to tell who had the
upper hand.  Ahim, slim and only about five feet tall, was more agile,
but Oni already seemed to have more raw strength.  Plus, he was aware
of who the real boss was around here and would get seriously upset if
Ahim kicked his butt.  Once Oni retrieved a knife from the kitchen
after a good-natured thrashing by Ahim and had enough emotional
momentum to leave a cut on Ahim's arm.  Kind of a scary character.<p>

Then there was John Lennon.  Little Johnny was a baby macaque that
Ahim found in the woods one day without a mother.  Now the unofficial
Waecicu mascot, he would climb up on the table at meal time and try to
grab a <em>krupuk</em> or stick his head into your glass of tea.  A baby
monkey is undeniably cute, but unfortunately an untrained one also
defecates at will.  It was definitely not a good idea to have Johnny
playing around your dinner plate before you finished eating.  He was
only about ten inches tall and was obviously still looking for a
mother figure, preferring to sleep against the bosom of a woman
whenever possible.  He became quite attached to Silke, and I remarked
that she should consider a career move from social work with drug
addicts to social work with orphan monkeys.  She replied that it would
still be the same work.<p>


<h2>Merpati, Again</h2>

The transience of life on the road: Dario, Elke, and J&uuml;rgen left
on the boat to Lombok in the morning, then Kuni departed in the
afternoon to catch the ferry to Sumbawa.  As I owed him a few dollars,
I promised to send Dario a bottle of Barrilitos 3-Star rum when I
returned to Puerto Rico.  The Hamburgers and I were the only guests
left at Waecicu.<p>

Finally Thursday arrived.  We bid adieu to John Lennon et al. and
headed out on the boat to Labuan Bajo.  After a brief stay in town,
sipping orange slurpees with chocolate syrup in a <em>warung</em>, we
took a <em>bemo</em> to the airport.<p>

&quot;This is the AIRPORT?&quot; Silke asked, aghast.  Well, what do you expect
for a place that services one flight per day?  The terminal looked all
right to me.  A nice, concrete, one-room building with a zinc-pan
roof, one door marked &quot;Departure&quot; and another marked &quot;Arrival.&quot;  In
fact, this was the new building.  The old one, with a thatched-roof
waiting-area gazebo, was standing, half-demolished and weed-infested,
50 feet away.  But it was disturbing that the doors were locked and no
one was there.<p>

It was only a few minutes before a woman in uniform came walking up
from the road.  Aha, she must have the keys, I thought.  Then she
opened her mouth: &quot;No flight today.  Please go to Merpati office.&quot;<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

At the Merpati office, where workers were tending the vegetable garden
out front, a man told us, &quot;Technical problem.  Airplane broke in
Kupang.&quot;  It has a broken heart, I whispered to Sabine and Silke.
&quot;Your tickets, please.  Will change date to tomorrow.&quot;  Are you sure?
we asked.  &quot;We will know this afternoon.  If no flight, we will call
you at your hotel.&quot;<p>

As we left the office, the man called out, &quot;Check in will begin at
8:35 am.  Please be on time.&quot;<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Checking into Chez Felix, a <em>losmen</em> with a phone, we told one of the
workers there that the Merpati flight today had been canceled.  With a
straight face he answered, &quot;Of course.&quot;  What do you mean? we asked.
&quot;Don't you know Merpati means 'maybe'?&quot; he replied.  (This was not
literally true; <em>merpati</em> means &quot;pigeon.&quot;) Then we met two young
English women who were also trying to fly out.  They had a friend in
the health center sick with malaria, and they were desperate to get
her out of Labuan Bajo and back to England.  Having booked later than
us, they were unfortunately on the waiting list for tomorrow.  So even
if the plane did show up in the morning they needed divine
intervention or the sudden, timely deaths of three other passengers
for them to be able to leave.  To their credit, they did not plead
with us, or try to bribe us, or attack us with their Swiss Army
knives.  As for me, having lived in a part of the world where getting
malaria was like catching a cold, I was not all that concerned.
&quot;She's being treated with Fanzidar?  She'll be all right in a couple
of days.&quot;<p>

Back in town, we attempted to satisfy Sabine's craving for spicy
Sumatran food by lunching at a Padang restaurant.  The protocol was
similar to that of dim sum: various dishes were brought out to your
table and you were only charged for the ones that you ate.  Sabine
explained, though, that you could spoon out the sauce from each dish
for free--a great concept for a sauce-o-phile like me.  Even though
the food was good, Sabine was disappointed by the lack of variety:
only fried chicken, chicken curry, dry-fried shrimp, potato
croquettes, fried-boiled eggs, and stewed greens.  A canned-beat disco
tape oddly reminiscent of Belizean punta rock blared in the
background.  We stared in fascination at a government calendar that
glorified the exploits of the military with collage paintings for each
month (I went up to the wall and flipped through the year): officers
in heroic poses, phallic missiles rising into the sky, a squadron of
fighter jets zooming across a Technicolor sunset, a muscular tank
commanding a hilltop position.  I wanted one as a souvenir, but I
could not find a store that sold them.  I guess I had to be there when
the propaganda wagon was rolled out.<p>

Later we met a man from Sulawesi who was trying to start a new beach
<em>losmen</em>.  When we told him about our predicament with the canceled
flight, he proceeded to regale us with more Merpati lore.<p>

For example: Merpati had lost four aircraft in and out of Flores.  The
last crash occurred only two months ago on the approach to Ruteng.
All 15 aboard died.  Bad weather was blamed.  The cause of an earlier
crash (Labuan Bajo to Bima--our flight) was never resolved (the wreck
was never recovered from the ocean), but sabotage was suspected
(V.I.P.s were on board).<p>

Another story: A group of Australians, who were not allowed on a
flight out of Labuan Bajo due to overbooking by Merpati, sat down
around the wheels of the airplane to block its departure.  After
several hours, the police and a few strong, young men were called in
from town to remove the Aussies.  A tense confrontation followed, but
in the end Merpati caved in and bumped off some ethnic Chinese women
who were trying to reach Ende in time for Chinese New Year.<p>

Finally, he told us an Indonesian take on the classic
crashing-airplane joke.  There were five passengers on an airplane: A
Japanese, a Chinese, an Arab, an European, and an Indonesian.
Suddenly the engines failed and they started to go down.  The Japanese
tried to get everyone to work together to repair the engines.  The
Chinese asked how much money was needed to fix the plane.  The Arab
looked for his ticket so he could get a refund.  The European put on
his parachute and got ready to jump.  And the Indonesian just sat
there arguing with everyone about why the airplane wasn't working.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Not believing that Merpati would actually call us at Chez Felix, I
went to the office in the late afternoon to check for news, but was
asked to return in half an hour when they would have a radio message
from Kupang.  Workers were still tending the vegetable garden.  After
a random walk, I went back as specified.  When I arrived, the woman
who gave us the bad news that morning, now sans uniform, led me around
to the back of the building.  In the front room there was a group of
women singing hymns.  The Merpati office obviously had many uses.  In
the back, the manager informed me that the flight was on for tomorrow.
And, yes, the check-in was at 8:35 am.<p>

That night, the women and I toasted our last night in Labuan Bajo (we
hoped) with a bottle of <em>arak</em>, a 70-proof liquor made from the sap of
palm trees.  A little alcohol goes a long way in restoring perspective
to an absurd situation.  So what if there was no flight tomorrow.  I
would just have to postpone my flight out of Bali for a few days.  We
could take the 8-hour ferry to Sape, Sumbawa (but not tomorrow--Friday
was the only day of the week on which the ferry did not run), then a
bus to Bima, then a Merpati (maybe) flight to Denpasar.  Or we could
take the slow boat to Lombok, then a ferry to Bali.  Or we could just
cancel the flights and keep traveling until our visas expired...<p>


<h2>Rain in Ruteng, Again</h2>

Friday morning: Suspicious that passengers on the waiting list might
try to bribe their way onto the flight, we went to the airport at 8:00
am.  There were already a dozen people waiting for the doors to be
unlocked.  The English girls were there, too, and I saw with a slight
pang of guilt that the malarial one looked like she had suffered quite
a bit lately.  She was gaunt, colorless, trying to be strong, making
an effort to joke with her friends, but her eyes were weak and watery,
her hand clutching a wad of toilet paper for the next trip to the
<em>mandi</em>.  I could tell she REALLY wanted to get out of here.  It was
not a life-or-death situation, but I thought about whether I should
offer her my seat.  On the other hand, she probably would not want to
go without her friends.<p>

The Merpati staff arrived remarkably on time.  Why they needed a
half-dozen workers for a once-a-day flight of 16 passengers was beyond
me.  As we began our check in, a portable bathroom scale was slid out
to weigh our baggage.  It was rather difficult to weigh a bag larger
than a purse because the dial would be covered up.  A mini concession
stand was set up, so you could relieve your thirst with a bottle of
warm Sprite or satisfy your nicotine craving with a pack of Marlboros.
I noted outside that the airport was equipped with a Mercedes-Benz
fire engine.<p>

Then around 9:30, the news was announced: Bad weather in Ruteng (did
that sound familiar?) was forcing the flight to come directly here
from Kupang.  Then the good part: Because all the passengers from
Kupang were going to Ruteng, the aircraft would start out empty for
our leg.  Therefore, everyone on the waiting list could go!  I didn't
have to feel guilty about the sick girl being left behind!  (Bad news
for the passengers waiting to leave Ruteng, though; they were screwed
for two straight days.)<p>

When the wailing siren (to clear the landing strip of playing
children) finally signalled the arrival of the airplane, the weather
here was turning for the worse, also.  As the disgruntled passengers
were disgorged from the twin-engine Otter (they would have to take the
five-hour bus to Ruteng), the Merpati staff piled our luggage on a
hand cart and prepared for departure.  When the aircraft was ready, we
quickly walked out of the terminal (to the ominous calls of &quot;Good
luck!&quot; from the locals) just as the first raindrops began to fall.  By
the time we left the ground it was raining in earnest.  However, once
we departed the coast of Flores and were flying above the ocean, the
sky cleared and we were all treated to an aerial view of the parched
savannah hills of the Komodos.  The Brit girls chattered away, half
excited, half nervous.  Sabine and Silke sat quietly admiring the
vistas.  The pilot and navigator blithely passed a bag of unshelled
peanuts back and forth.  And I had just begun the first leg of a
seven-flight itinerary to return to the opposite side of the Earth;
there was nothing to do but to sit back and enjoy the flight to Bima.<p>
