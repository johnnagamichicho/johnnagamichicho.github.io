<center><h1>Socks!</h1></center>

At first, Fern could only scream, her eyes shut tight, expecting any
moment to crash painfully down onto a hard ground.  But when she
realized that her fall was not about to end any time soon, she slowly
opened her eyes.  This did not help in the least, because she was
falling down a completely dark hole.  She knew she ought to be scared
out of her wits, but somehow she was starting to feel calmer all the
time.<p>

Presently, the air rushing past her began to feel warmer.  And warmer.
Soon Fern began to sweat.  She decided to take off her jacket.
Carefully, she tied the arms of the jacket around her waist, so she
wouldn't lose it.<p>

Then below her, Fern began to see a soft reddish glow.  At first she
thought her eyes were playing tricks on her, but soon she was able to
see her own arms and legs reflecting the dim light.  She could also
see the walls of the tunnel rushing past her at a great speed, which
made her feel a bit uneasy.  She had felt safer when she could not see
how fast she was going.<p>

As she fell toward the light, it became brighter and the air got
hotter.  Finally it became so bright that even when she screwed her
eyes shut real tight, it seemed like her eyes were wide open looking
at a bright red wall.  And it became so hot that she thought her hair
would curl up.<p>

<em>I can't stand this any more</em>, she thought.  Tears squeezed out
from her tightly shut eyes.<p>

But then she noticed a cooler breeze blowing toward her.  And the
light all around her began to fade slowly.  When she opened her
eyes, she saw that she was now falling toward a dark spot.  It was
like she was in a movie that was being played backwards!<p>

Soon she was falling again in darkness.  The temperature went from
unbearably hot to comfortably warm.<p>

Then suddenly as she had been first sucked down the hole, she found
herself coughed up on a ground covered with wet grass.  It was night
time.  Fern could see the moon overhead, peeking through what seemed
to be tree branches.  When she looked around (Fern could see quite
well because her eyes were adjusted to the dark hole) she saw a
strange sight: the ground around her was covered with socks!  Adult
socks and children's socks--she thought she recognized one of
Stinky's.  But when she collected them, she found that none of them
matched into pairs.<p>
