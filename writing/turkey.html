<h1>From Istanbul to Van: A Turkish Traverse</h1>

<h2>Istanbul, 1</h2>

In countries where prices are considerably below the G-7 average,
there is always the exception of the cost of getting into town from
the international airport.  Usually one can sidestep this obstacle by
going over to the domestic terminal (where there are buses headed to
the city center), or by going to the nearest train or subway station.
As long as you are not in a hurry, the public-transport option saves
money and gives you an immediate flavor of every-day life in the
strange new country.  (Think of a first-time U.S. visitor going into
Manhattan from JFK using the subway.)  Old Istanbul was a 25-cent,
40-minute train ride from the airport.  The carriage had missing
fluorescent lights and a door that refused to open and close when it
was supposed to.  A beggar and several peddlers (young boys) with
petty merchandise in plastic garbage bags--pencils, batteries,
notebooks--made their rounds, while stubble-faced men flipped through
prayer beads with deft flicks of the wrist and old women with head
scarves stared out the window at the Sea of Marmara.<p>

Getting off at Cankurtaran (good thing I had kept count of the
stations, for there were neither announcements nor platform signs), I
walked up alleys and crooked streets to the Sultanahmet area, which is
the heart of the old city.  This was essentially a back-door entrance
and lacked the drama of steaming into the Golden Horn by sea with its
classic views of the mosque domes and minarets crowning the hilltops.
But for postcard views one could always buy the postcards.<p>

One thing quickly became apparent: This was a <em>serious</em> tourist
zone.  The style of hard-sell was smooth-aggressive, largely
formulaic, but occasionally oblique.  The most common was the "What is
the time, please?" gambit, where if you answer back the would-be
seller would chat you up with whatever tidbits he knew about your
country and eventually got around to mentioning that his brother owned
a carpet shop just around the corner, how about going there and
sipping some apple tea with us, no need to buy anything.  All the
big-league tourist languages--English, German, Japanese,
<em>Australian</em>--were covered, and there was always a relative
living in your country.  "Where are you from?"  "Mars."  "Oh, Mars!
Wonderful place.  I have cousin there who has a restaurant . . . "
The most entertaining attempt at luring me into a carpet shop was by a
very well-dressed middle-aged man, who, upon discovering that I was an
American, pulled out the business cards of a Major So-and-so of the
CIA and a Ms.  Such-and-such, Executive Assistant to Mrs. Bush, and
told me the tale of George's visit to his store and the Presidential
purchase of one measly carpet.  It may even have been true, but why
would I have wanted to buy a carpet at the same store that Bush bought
from?<p>

Turkey in general has a brain-boggling depth of recorded history, and
the physical stratigraphy of Istanbul (n&eacute;e Constantinople,
n&eacute;e Byzantium, n&eacute;e Lygos, n&eacute;e Semistra) in
particular retains the memory of peoples and religions that had gained
ascendancy at one time or another.  Look at Aya Sofya, the grandest
cathedral of early Christendom turned into fifteenth century's
greatest mosque by Mehmet the Conqueror, the iconography covered over
by arabesques.  Or how the inscriptions on monuments have turned from
Greek to Arabic to Turkish (Arabic script) to Turkish (Latin script).
I had to concentrate just to keep the various periods in order:
<em>Let's see, Hittite, Hellenic, Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman
. . . oops, forgot the Seljuks--they're in there somewhere.</em><p>

Topkap&#305; Palace, the Egyptian Bazaar, the Covered Market, the Blue
Mosque--all very impressive, but my favorite sight of old Istanbul was
the Yerebatan Saray ("sunken palace"), an underground cistern built in
the sixth century by Justinian the Great to store and redistribute
fresh water brought in by an aqueduct.  It is 80 x 150 yards and 30
feet high, supported by 336 Ionian and Corinthian columns with the
occasional carving to catch you off guard, even an upside-down capital
with a Medusa head.  Why the ornamentation?  Was this a secret
swimming hole for the privileged on scorching August afternoons,
flickeringly lit by smoking torches?  Now the water has been mostly
drained and wooden walkways installed for anyone to enjoy its
sepulchral ambience.  The colored mood lighting and the piped-in New
Age music was a bit much, however.<p>

Nightlife in Istanbul conjures images of kohl-eyed belly dancers
performing in front of corpulent men with sweaty palms reclining on
oversized cushions and stuffing their faces with legs of lamb.  As
with most such dated stereotypes (like Turkish coffee--popular during
the time of the Ottomans' colonization of Arabia, these days tea is
the national drink and one is hard-pressed to find anything stronger
than Nescaf&eacute;), belly dancing has been superannuated as a
typical mode of Turkish entertainment.  But tourism and purists have
kept it alive and one can certainly pay a lot of money for the chance
to watch a performance at a four-star hotel or at more dubious night
clubs where the emphasis may slide right off the women's dancing
skills down to more fundamental concerns.<p>

An interesting alternative was the free belly-dance performance that
took place every Friday night in the rooftop restaurant of the Orient
Youth Hostel.  <em>The</em> backpacker hangout of the moment in
Istanbul, the median age of the international SRO crowd must have been
around 21.  True to Turkish time, the start time rolled around and
kept going while the youths smoked and drank beer (but not too
much--alcohol is always the heaviest load on the budget traveler),
while Eurodisco boomed and a vintage mirror ball spun overhead.  When
the trio of instrumentalists dressed in concert-black suits entered
the room, the cassette was abruptly ejected and the crowd hushed
itself.  They began with an ensemble overture, then a short
<em>taksim</em> (solo) by each to display their chops: the
<em>klarinet</em>, the <em>deblek</em> (small hand drum), then the
<em>kanun</em> (box zither).  To me they seemed competent but sloppy,
as if the venue and audience were not enough to merit their full
attention.  Then the dancer, a compact, high-teens girl with long,
wavy black hair, entered the fray and proceeded to entertain us with a
very interactive show.  Unsuspecting members of the audience (both men
and women) were dragged one by one to the front to shake and shimmy
their stuff with the professional, some with more enthusiasm than
others.  With the men, she would take off their shirts in rhythm, much
to the delight of the female spectators.  Fortunately I managed to
elude being chosen, but little did I know that later on this trip I
would be forced to perform in front of a much bigger gathering . . .<p>

<h2>Gallipoli</h2>

Because of the still-cold weather, I left Istanbul after a few days in
search of a better April climate.  After a choppy crossing of the Sea
of Marmara in a hydrofoil, then a brief stay in Bursa where hot
springs helped to warm me up, I kept moving westward by bus seeking
the moderating influence of the Aegean Sea.  And knowing nothing, I
happened to arrive in &Ccedil;anakkale only ten days before ANZAC Day,
when the town's location across the strait from the Gallipoli
Peninsula turns it into the largest collection of Vegemite and Marmite
eaters this side of the Great Barrier Reef.<p>

Gallipoli.  To me it was a movie that I had not seen, starring a
pre-superstardom Mel Gibson.  To the Downunderers it becomes Mecca on
Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) Day, and every year
12,000 of them make the pilgrimage to where 10,000 of their ancestors
were slaughtered in a futile attempt to force open the Dardanelles
during WWI. The hotels and pensions of &Ccedil;anakkale are well
prepared for this latter-day onslaught by the Antipodeans, with free
nightly showings of the film <em>Gallipoli</em> as well as a
documentary on the ANZAC pilgrimage phenomenon itself.  What is less
known by Westerners is that an estimated 250,000 Turks died defending
the short stretch of ridge on this slender peninsula, and that the
then-obscure Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, founder of the modern
Turkish republic (later to be decreed Kemal Atat&uuml;rk, literally
"Father Turk," by the legislative assembly while still in office),
made his mark by successfully repelling the ANZACs.  It was a crucial
point in Turkish history, as the loss of Gallipoli would have
undoubtedly resulted in the opening of the Dardanelles to British
warships, which then would have led to an easy sacking of
Constantinople, and thence the rest of the tottering Ottoman Empire.
Thus, although the Turks were ultimately on the losing side of the
war, they were able to keep their homeland from being colonized by the
Europeans.<p>

But the obvious question for the pilgrims was: Why commemorate a
bloody military campaign that resulted in ignominious defeat? I put
this question to the Aussie and Kiwi lodgers at the Yellow Rose
Pension and received largely similar answers.  The basic idea was
this: Australia and New Zealand, as newly independent nations, were
eager to prove their mettle when the call came from England during WWI
to contribute soldiers.  Young men (even underage boys who lied to get
in) joined up in droves, knowing nothing about their destination.  So
Point One was to honor those innocents that fought bravely and died in
a strange, faraway land for a cause that was not their own.  Point Two
was that in the aftermath of Gallipoli, the innocence was forever
lost, and the countries staked their "true" independence from Mother
Britannia.  So, in effect, they were commemorating the loss of
national virginity.  Never again would they jump like lemmings off a
cliff to prove themselves worthy.<p>

Most of the pilgrims were of the same young age as the original
ANZACs.  And in my brief observation they were just as tight among
themselves in their mateship and still as self-conscious of their
place in the world, and many who were almost as ignorant of Turks and
their homeland as the soldiers who landed 82 years ago.  Perhaps I was
being harsh, but the irony was that they were still eager to root
themselves in some defining historical moment, still trapped within
the young-nation complex.  The Turks, although they worship
Atat&uuml;rk, do not make a big deal out of Gallipoli.  To them it is
just one recent victory in a string of others reaching back for
hundreds of years.  They have a well-developed sense of themselves as
a "people" and a nation, but this has its own drawbacks as we shall
see later with respect to the Kurds.<p>

<h2>Sacrificial Lambs and Marble Toilets</h2>

Exiting the Dardanelles, rounding the northwest corner of Turkey,
southward along the Aegean coast.  Greek islands just offshore faced
by hollow-bricked condo-like buildings sprouting up among clumps of
pine trees.  Arrived in Bergama (Pergamum) just in time to catch the
frenzy of sheep buying at the pre-holiday bazaar.  A muddy field just
outside of town center was teeming with horse- and tractor-drawn carts
and trucks full of sheep marked with orange and red dyes.  Small
tent-shelters were set up for tea and kebap, both rancher and would-be
buyer biding their time for the best possible deal.<p>

Kurban Bayaram&#305;, the most important religious holiday of the year,
celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac in
obedience to Allah.  Since it was only a test of faith, Abraham was
allowed at the last moment to kill a sheep instead.  The custom is for
every household that can afford a sheep to sacrifice it and share it
with those with less means.  At the pension where I was staying, the
owner had purchased a ram for $150.  It grazed quietly in the front
yard, but later butted a window, shattering the glass.  The owner
joked that if it wanted to come inside, it should be allowed to watch
TV with the rest of the family on its last night.<p>

Next morning, 8:30 am.  Clear sky, slight but chilly breeze.  At the
call from the mosque, the ram's feet are bound together, it is laid
down next to a pre-dug hole, its throat is slit by an old man with a
knife, the blood pumping out into the hole, steam rising from the warm
dark fluid.  When the blood slows to an ooze, the head is sawed off,
the skinning of the carcass begins at the hind legs.  The skinning
continues as the body is hung from a tree in front of the house, a
status symbol of religious piety and wealth.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Turkey's Aegean coast is littered with ruins of Hellenic and Roman
cities.  Troy, Priene, Miletus, Didyma, Iasos, Kaunos.  Amphitheaters
and temples and palaces and gymnasiums and fountains.  Sculptures and
tombs and engravings, but again, as in Istanbul with the great
cistern, I was most impressed with a bit of civil engineering at
Ephesus: continuously flushing sit-down marble toilets!  And they say
that running hot water was even available.<p>

After visiting several of these historic sites I stopped trying to
figure out who built what was sacked by whom did they worship, etc.
and started noticing signs like "Please don't picnic on the ruins" and
"Some children may be disturbed by this exhibit" (the latter at the
entrance to the torture chamber of St. Peter's Castle in Bodrum).  And
I was getting tired of the rapid bus-lodge-eat-sightsee-bus pace of
travel.  It was time to hang out and absorb for a while.<p>

<h2>Ka&#351;</h2>

My strategy had worked.  The Aegean had been considerably warmer than
Istanbul, and as I segued into the Mediterranean coast (which reminded
me of the southern California coastline north of L.A. in terrain and
vegetation) I found myself switching to shorts on occasion.  Sometimes
the road would turn inland and switchback up a steep mountainside with
sudden, rewarding vistas of sea and islands at the pass.  At other
times it twisted its way up, guard-rail-less, to thrilling heights
above ultraclear waters that could only be called turquoise in color,
leaving you hoping that the evil-eye charm and the printed invocation,
"Allah korusun!" ("God save us!"), at the front of the bus did not
mean that the driver had abdicated all control of the vehicle to the
supernatural.  Avoiding the upscale yacht-harbor towns where the
beautiful set bought each other $5 beers and danced the night away in
massive discos built to look like extraterrestrial "Greek" temples
from the old Star Trek series, I kept moving until I came to
Ka&#351;, a small port town of 5000 folks squeezed into a narrow
space between "Sleeping Man" Mountain and the sea.  Just a couple of
miles across the water lay the tiny Greek isle of Kastellorizon, so
small that its inhabitants had to ferry into Ka&#351; for groceries.
Lycian tombs carved into the sheer mountainside looked down on the
town where a small dockside plaza acted as the focus for commercial
and social activities.<p>

I was immediately charmed by this place and decided to stay for a
while.  I took a room at the Golden Pension for $5/night, which had a
rooftop terrace from where you could look out over all of
Ka&#351;.<p>

The Golden is managed by Hakk&#305; and Ismail, childhood buddies from
nearby Finike.  They rent two stories of the building, with the
landlord's family living on the other floors.  They also sleep in the
pension, Hakk&#305; on a couch in the common room, Ismail preferring the
cot on the porch.  Their dinner tonight consists of home-cooked fries
with lemon juice and slices of bread.  They invite me to eat with them
in the kitchen, and we sit around the rest of the evening talking over
glasses of watery Izmir wine and listening to Turkish pop music on
cassettes.<p>

Hakk&#305; is the older partner at 29.  He has long hair, unusual for a
Turk, and a sad face.  He looks more like 35.  Ismail is short and
compact with a chubby, unshaven face.  He is 23.  Both of them have
connections to Germany, with Ismail having lived in M&ouml;nchengladbach
(where I once lived and worked for a summer) between the ages of 3 and
8, and Hakk&#305; with a daughter there that he has never seen.  Before he
came to Ka&#351; to co-manage the Golden at Ismail's invitation, Hakk&#305;
had run an inn at Finike with a German partner/girlfriend.  But the
unknown child was the result of a relationship with another German
girl in his teen years.  He had refused to go to Germany with her and
she had refused to stay in Turkey.<p>

I ask Hakk&#305; about his mandatory eighteen months in the military.  A
lot of hiking around in the mountains.  Not knowing where he was at
any given time, just following commands.  Always jumpy about the PKK
(the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party) ambushing his patrol.  But he
emphasizes that the PKK is not supported by most Kurds.  "PKK, Kurdish
people, separate."  He managed to get through his term without
shooting anyone.<p>

The subject turns to the origin of the Turkish people.  (Ismail leaves
to chase after Liz, a Welsh boarder.)  The Turks originally came from
Central Asia, and Hakk&#305; is keen to identify himself as more "yellow"
than "white."  He believes the future of the country lies in becoming
a leader and socio-political role model for the newly independent
Central Asian nations with linguistic and historical ties to the
Turks.  He says that Turkey could be like the United States to them.
He does not favor integration with the EC, saying that Turkey would
always be the bottom dog.  On another night, after several beers, he
starts claiming that Chinggis Khan was Turkish, that it's the mixing
of blood that makes the modern Turks look different.  His surname is
Tan, which means "dawn," and he insists that it is the same as the
Chinese Tan.  Somehow I doubt this, since surnames only became <em>de
rigueur</em> for the Turks after Atat&uuml;rk decreed it to be so in
1935.  He thinks that I should grow a long trailing mustache to look
like a warlord.<p>

In the daylight hours I scramble up to the Lycian tombs, explore the
Antiphellus ruins, and laze about on warm rocks by the sea.  One day I
take a two-hour boat ride out to Kekova Island where half of a
Byzantine town lies submerged under water, the severe consequence of
an ancient earthquake.  I dive into the water for a closer look but
manage only a few minutes because of the cold.  On the mainland shore
there is a necropolis and a medieval fortress to explore.  Several old
women from the nearby village come out to hawk scarves with tiny
shells and trinkets sewn onto them.<p>

Back at the Golden I help Hakk&#305; "fix" the stereo (all it needed was
the right antenna hookup and the right selector button pushed in) and
give him a lesson on how to compute percentages using a calculator.
It is tax time and he has a pained expression on his face.  He and
Ismail have big dreams for the future, but no matter how frugal they
are, the money never seems to amount to much.  The standard joke here
is that every Turk is a millionaire, with one million Turkish lira
equal to about $8.  With annual inflation still running over 80%,
billionaire status may be within reach of many soon.  Hakk&#305; shows me a
lottery ticket with a top prize of $800,000.  "How many Mercedes-Benz
is that?" he asks.  About ten, I guess.  "Nicht genug," he sadly
replies.  He means not enough to retire on.  I ask him what he would
then do with the $800k.  He says he would hire twenty to thirty men
and start a drug smuggling business.  He does not seem to be joking.
There is already a Turkish mafia in Germany, he says.  His take on
this is simple: They oppress us, we take advantage of them.  He sees
the Turks working hard, getting rich there, while German youth being
lazy, ("Drug, drink, sex . . ."), jealous of the Turks' success.  His
bitterness then comes spilling out, eyes swollen with indignation and
beer.  Even though he has never lived there he equates the Turks in
Germany to blacks in America.  "Turkey" on the other hand "treats all
people equally," he says, never drawing the home analogy to the
Kurds.<p>

Ismail is back early tonight.  On the radio Muazzez Ers&ouml;y croons
of love gone bad.  "This is my music," he says.  "I'm going to
cry."<p>

<h2>The Tree House Mafia</h2>

I happened to be reading Pynchon's <em>Vineland</em>, so it was with
an eerie sense of life-imitating-art that I first walked into Kadir's
Y&ouml;r&uuml;k Tree House joint.  I was immediately greeted with "You
from the AFRC, too?" from a buzzhead ex-football player and a "Do you
play ping pong?" from a tie-dyed hippie fossil.  Then an ultraperky
blonde in a red "Maine" sweatshirt ("Yep, that's where I'm from!")
explained the tree house rules at 90 mph, "Put yer valuables in the
safe, everything on a tab system, breakfast and all-you-can-eat
vegetarian dinner included in the daily six bucks, hot water twice a
day, no sex in the tree house (do it on the beach or in the woods away
from others), do you have a sleeping bag?  No?  Then you'll need four
blankets, just let me know if you need anything else, okay?  My
husband Rick and I were traveling around Europe for our honeymoon last
fall, ended up in Turkey, then here, and haven't left yet!" There were
26 tree houses in total, with names like Fawlty Towers, Wookey Hole,
Banana Republic, Love Shack, Nuthouse?, Pooh Corner, and Chocolate
Factory, scattered among a volleyball court, ping pong table, and
hammocked shelters.  Fiona (the Maine girl) told me that the place
could hold 160 lodgers, and that they expected to reach capacity
during the high summer season.  Other copycat tree house camps had
sprung up toward the beach with largely the same deal, some inside
citrus groves.  The place looked like a denied or repressed child's
fantasy gone berserk as an adulthood business scheme.  It was a
retro-counterculture summer camp, a pocket of refuge from reality and
Turkey for international backpackers.  It looked like a movie set
built in the forests of Humboldt County.  And, quite appropriately, a
satellite boob tube radiated cartoons, B movies, music videos, and
football matches all day long in the cafeteria.  Besides Fiona and
Rick who worked there, there were lodgers who had been stuck there for
months, addicted to the space-time warp, the easy friendships, the
ping pong tournaments, that third helping of pasta and fried eggplant
with yoghurt sauce.  (By the way, AFRC = Armed Forces Recreation
Center, a little-known U.S. military perk that employs civilian sports
instructors at resorts all over the world.  For some unknown reason
Kadir's was overpopulated with ex-ski instructors from the AFRC
program in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.)<p>

But aside from this fantasy theme park, the area was sparsely
inhabited and still gorgeous.  The ruins of Olimpos, a town with a
history reaching back at least as far as the second century BC, were
scattered in the narrow river valley and along the coastal rock
outcroppings, rewarding the serendipitous hiker with unexpected finds
of a sarcophagus here, an aqueduct there.  On the pebbly beach one
could greet local fishermen coming back from the day's haul, and
perhaps be presented with a fresh fish after a friendly chat.  At
night one could make a trip to the nearby Chimaera, where natural gas
seeping out through cracks in a rocky slope had kept a field of flames
burning since history began to be recorded, to bask in the light that
was once used as a lighthouse by sailors, or to toast a marshmallow or
two in the eternal campfire.<p>

Kadir's Tree House was, of course, owned by Kadir who used the excuse
that the aboriginal Y&ouml;r&uuml;ks used tree-based shelters (they were
actually lean-tos rather than treetop houses) to start the business
that, in only a few years, had become the hottest open secret on the
backpacker trail.  It was a brilliant move, and clearly showed signs
of a deep understanding of his clientele, but against all expectations
he was not the affable, effusive bloke who personally greeted each one
of his guests with humor and hospitality, imparting easily digestible
dollops of insight into Turkish culture and thought, leaving the
impartee with a warm, fuzzy feeling of having made contact with a
"cool" local.  No; instead, everything about him screamed "mafia
boss."  He did not deign to speak to any of his lodgers, and every
word to his staff was a command.  Sometimes he would hold a business
dinner in front of the TV with other senior colleagues, all dressed in
leather jackets, picking at their specially prepared fish, drinking
rak&#305; (the Turkish equivalent of <em>uzo</em>), and cutting deals over the
portable phone.  Junior members would come up to them to pay their
proper respects, then sit down in a far corner sipping beers.  What
nefarious schemes were they cooking up?  "Discouraging" their new
competitors with mysterious "lightning fires"?  New tree house
operations in other promising Mediterranean locales?  Or going whole
hog--an international tree house franchise?  I could see it now: a
big, golden "K" made to look like a dancing tree supporting a hut full
of smiling, youthful faces.  "You de-serve a tree today.  So get up
and get away.  To Kadiiiir's--we built it all for youuu!"<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

Back in my Penthouse I met an Aussie who was fleeing the tidal wave of
post-ANZAC pilgrims now emanating from Gallipoli.  He told me that a
riot broke out at night after all the memorial services were over.
Some Turkish teenagers had allegedly tried to abduct a few Australian
girls.  Aussie boys, rather plastered (as the ANZAC Day custom called
for a serious bout of group inebriation), had responded violently (or
tried to) in defense of their national honor.  The police had to be
called in to break up the melee, and a few bruised egos had to spend
the night in jail.  Turks 2, Aussies 0.<p>

<h2>Of Armpits, Politics, and a Family Feud</h2>

After brief stays in E&#287;irdir and Konya, then several days in a
renovated troglodyte dwelling in G&ouml;reme (imagine valleyfuls of
ancient Bryce Canyon-type towers hollowed out into condominiums and
cathedrals by skillful excavators--the scene looked extraterrestrial;
in fact, a part of <em>Star Wars</em> was filmed there), I decided to
leave the tourist trail and headed southeast.  Because of the ongoing
Kurdish insurgency, foreigners were discouraged from venturing further
east than Cappadocia for fear of kidnappings, which had ruined more
than one vacation in the past.  From talking with locals I judged that
traveling in the southeast would be safe enough if I stuck to daytime
public transport only--the PKK favored private cars traveling at
night.  I thought of the situation as a blessing designed to allow
bold (stupid?) travelers escape the hassles and disappointments
associated with oft-visited sites.<p>

And the difference was stark.  Between Adana, where tea sellers at the
bus station were shoving filled glasses into my hand and expecting
payment, and &#350;anl&#305;urfa, where people hung around just to
practice some English with you, there seemed to be a magic line.
Landscapewise it had turned extremely flat, with a massive scale of
irrigation that recalled the San Joaquin Valley.  Turkey is a
food-exporting nation and I was entering the Fertile Crescent, having
just crossed the Euphrates, which had been dammed to create Lake
Atat&uuml;rk (the downstream Syrians were not happy about this).  "The
cradle of civilization"--echoes of history and geography lessons from
childhood.  The recent expansion of irrigation and the revival of
agriculture in this desert was part of the GAP (Greater Anatolia
Project), which was a governmental effort to bump up the living
standard of the Kurds.  The idea was that if you make them richer they
will forget about not being able to maintain their own cultural
identity.  So far it did not seem to be working.  (More on this
later.)<p>

Urfa had been recently renamed &#350;anl&#305;urfa ("Glorious Urfa") by
the national government in belated recognition for playing a key
defensive role in one battle or another.  It seemed to be yet another
attempt to instill patriotism for Turkey, as other southeastern cities
had also gained such stirring prefixes as Gazi ("Defender of the
Faith") and Kahraman ("Heroic").  But Urfa was Urfa to most people.<p>

Roughly 50% Kurdish, 35% Turkish, and 15% Arabic, Urfa was the first
multiethnic city that I had seen in Turkey, outside of Istanbul.  This
fact was apparent in the variety of dress and in the stalls of the
wonderfully chaotic bazaar.  With no other Western tourists in sight,
I was able to leisurely walk through the various sections: the
rhythmic clanging of copper sheets being pounded into pots, pungent
wafts from volcanic mounds of crushed red peppers of varying hue,
tobacco, nuts, and grains, sampling a strange fruit reminiscent of the
Japanese
<em>biwa</em>, the meat section full of sheep heads and sundry other
organs as well as the usual cuts, the weighty glitter of gold in the
jewelry row, the quietness of the kilim and carpet shops, then popping
out unexpectedly into a caravansary courtyard where old men hung out
smoking, playing backgammon, and sipping their tiny tulip-shaped
glasses of hot tea.<p>

Actually Urfa does get its share of foreign visitors, albeit mostly
from other Islamic countries.  Claiming the birth cave of Abraham, Old
Urfa is a sacred site for the faithful.  Inside the cave is a holy
fountain, which is assisted these days by an electric pump.  The
pilgrim is free to take a drink from it for good luck.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

While in Urfa I got the notion to visit a Turkish bath for the
works--massage, scrubbing, and all.  So I received directions to go by
bus to the Alican Hamam in the suburbs, figuring that it would be one
of the least touristy baths in Turkey.  I figured right, for when I
stepped into this <em>hamam</em> (which was situated in the basement
of a modern apartment building) quite a commotion ensued.<p>

None of the workers there spoke English, so it was a comic pantomime.
It was not so hard to get across to them that I wanted everything
done, so after that it was just following the attendants through the
various stages.  They wanted their foreign guest to go away with a
good impression, so they brought out their best masseur, who,
predictably, looked like an amateur wrestler.  The procedure went like
this.  I was given a key to a private booth where I undressed and
stored my clothes, and a large piece of gray cloth that I wrapped
around my waist.  I was then taken to a sauna where I sat bleeding
sweat until I had to exit and jump into a cold-water pool.  Then back
into the sauna, then out to be laid flat on a towel for the massage.
It was a bit unnerving to have a very strong man manipulating your
muscles and joints, jarred by strange cracking sounds on occasion, not
knowing what he was going to do next.  I can't say that I enjoyed
it--in fact, it was rather painful, and I came out of it with a bruise
on my lower back.  Next was the skin-peeling session, which, I
suppose, they think of as merely a thorough scrub down.  The
attendant, armed with a loofah mitten, scoured my body repeatedly,
sloughing off wet skin that looked like dog-chewed wads of paper
towel.  Then came the semaphore-question: the attendant raising one
arm and making a rubbing motion with his other hand under the armpit.
I took this to mean, "Do you want soap for your armpits?"  So I
blithely nodded "Yes."  The next thing that occurred was like a dream
sequence happening in slow motion, but about which you can do nothing.
Another attendant arrived with a razor, and, raising my left arm, in a
few swift strokes my armpit had been shaved for the first time in my
life.  At that point it seemed useless to prevent the other one from
being shaved, so I said nothing.  I found out later that it is a
religious custom to keep your armpits shaved.<p>

The next day I made an excursion to Harran, about ten miles from the
Syrian border and one of the oldest continuously inhabited villages on
Earth.  Lacking public transport I went with &Ouml;zcan, a primary
school teacher in the subjects of Turkish, math, and manners, who
moonlighted as a guide.  He was studying for the national English
exam, which, if passed, would qualify him to teach English at a
university.  In 1990 he scored 60; he needed 90 to pass.  Recently he
began studying again and was memorizing 270 words per week.  He kept
asking me questions: "What is the difference between 'dwell' and
'live'?"  "How do you use 'forsake'?"  He was very happy to talk with
me, as native English speakers were scarce in Urfa.<p>

As we drove southward through pistachio orchards, I asked &Ouml;zcan,
an ethnic Turk and a committed secularist, about politics.  He had
nothing but contempt for the current line-up of political leaders.
"Politics in Turkey is bullshit.  [President] Demirel is a liar.
[Deputy Prime Minister] &Ccedil;iller is two-faced.  [Prime Minister]
Erbakan is even worse."  He was especially angry at the Islamist
Welfare Party that was leading the coalition government at the time.
[As I write this in June 1997, Erbakan has just stepped down under
intense pressure by the secularist military, with promise of an early
election.]  He claimed that the Islamic middle schools were teaching
anti-Atat&uuml;rk ideas.  He felt that the Koran should only be taught
in government-controlled schools, not in the private imam-hatip
schools.  (In fact, &Ccedil;iller, leader of the center-right
secularist True Path Party, had just announced a proposal to extend
mandatory public education from five to eight years, thereby
eliminating the role of the rapidly expanding imam-hatips.)  As I had
heard many times by now, he voiced his fears of Turkey turning into
another Algeria, succumbing to creeping fundamentalism.  The irony, it
seemed to me, was that in their paranoia (justified, perhaps) the
Turkish military was about to make the same mistake made in Algeria:
cracking down too hard and further polarizing the society.  But on the
other hand, the military was the most trusted public institution in
Turkey, and had taken over the reins of government more than once with
the approval of the majority of citizens.<p>

At Harran, a sun-baked collective of "beehive" mud huts (actually,
with the domes grouped in pairs and with the vent stones perched on
top, they looked like a field of women's breasts), we happened to
coincide with a government press briefing about the successes of the
Greater Anatolia Project.  A tent shelter had been set up to provide
shade for the journalists (mostly from Europe), who, with their
plastic name badges and "GAP" baseball caps were busy scribbling and
shooting videos and stills.  Midsummer afternoon temperatures can
climb up to 120 degrees; today it was a comfy late-spring temperature
of around 90.  A Brit came up to me and whispered, "They say this area
has recently been <em>liberated</em>."  The mayor of Harran spoke hopefully
about the great tourist and business potential of the region; he
himself did not seem entirely convinced.  Meanwhile, the villagers
went about their daily business (which meant, at this time of day,
staying inside the shadow of their huts) with hardly an ear for the
eloquence of the spin doctors.<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

On the return drive &Ouml;zcan asked about "blood law."  I figured out
that he meant a feud.  For the past year he had been employing a
teenage boy, Hasan, for odd jobs out of favor to a friend.  Hasan had
had his father and his brother killed by an uncle, who was arrested
and convicted, but had been freed after only three months thanks to
connections and money.  Now everyone expected Hasan to take revenge
and kill his uncle.  It was more than an expectation, it was an
honorable obligation.  But he did not want to murder, and so he had to
hide in shame in a far away town.  Now he only wanted to leave Turkey
forever.  &Ouml;zcan said Hasan was studying electronics.  "Such a
nice boy," he said.  "There are some stupid ways that never die."<p>

<h2>Into the Zone</h2>

Further east of Urfa the GAP irrigation stopped.  Huge farms gave way
to sheep and cow ranching and pointillistic fields of wild
flowers--red, yellow, lavender.  But the soil was still dark and rich,
and the pipelines were inexorably on their way.  Right before entering
Diyarbak&#305;r, located on the northwest corner of the Kurdish homeland,
our bus was stopped at the first military checkpoint I had encountered
in Turkey.  IDs were examined, then we were waved into the
Extraordnance Zone.  From here on our progress would be hindered by a
checkpoint every thirty miles or so.<p>

Diyarbak&#305;r is ringed by a tall, black basalt, Byzantine wall that is
almost entirely intact.  I walked on top of it for part of its
four-mile length and got an excellent view of the adjacent Tigris
River meandering through small-scale farms, and also got a feeling for
the city's layout, which was based on a simple ring-and-cross road
system.  Beyond those main roads the neighborhoods were riddled with
narrow alleys that were a pleasure to wander through because they were
inaccessible to cars, not to mention the tanks and armored personnel
carriers that were parked with casual deliberateness on the main
thoroughfares.<p>

The city wall, built originally to keep invaders out, had taken on a
more sinister aspect with the traffic cops with their Kalashnikovs,
and the roar and throb of fighter jets and helicopters overhead.
(Nearby was an air force base from which the military launched raids
on PKK camps.)  Diyarbak&#305;r had the look of a prison with 380,000
inmates.  Or, perhaps closer to reality, it looked like an occupied
city.<p>

As in Urfa people were very curious about me.  Buying a Fanta at a
kiosk I would be offered a chair by the friendly seller, and then
suddenly be surrounded by primary school students in their
jacket-tie-and-shorts uniforms.  Even though none of them knew more
than a few words of English (and my Turkish limited to practical
phrases like "How much?" and the ability to count numbers), we still
managed to have some fun.  But there was always at least one good
English speaker in any city, and that person would find you because
foreigners were so rare and obvious in these parts.<p>

Kumar (not his real name) spotted me right away on the north-south
avenue and introduced himself.  He had worked for Stephen Kinzer, who
was reporting about the Kurds in Iraq for the <em>New York Times</em>,
accompanying him across the border as his interpreter.  He also
recounted to me of his months in mandatory service, sweating bullets
at the prospect of having to shoot a fellow Kurd.  He was eager to
talk to me about the situation in Diyarbak&#305;r, so after showing me
around town we went into an inconspicuous tea house, away from the
prying eyes and ears of the police and military.  Because he was the
filter through which foreigners unable to speak either Turkish or
Kurdish received their "facts," I knew I had to leave room for some
skepticism.  But with that in mind, I present what he told me that
afternoon without alterations.<p>

<ul>
<li>There is no democracy in Turkey.  It is a fascist-nationalist state
always looking for Atat&uuml;rk to return from the dead and tell them what
to do.  The political leaders are afraid to lead, because they are
labeled a traitor by the others if they deviate from the Kemalist
doctrine.  Same old men--Demirel, Erbakan, Ecevit--same old thinking.
But the younger generation is no different.

<li>Kurds only want to be able to speak their own language, run their
own schools, and have their own TV channel.  The Kurds had asked for
these things, but the government gave them handouts instead, creating
an unwanted dependency.

<li>When Tansu &Ccedil;iller was Prime Minister, she convinced the West
to give money to combat militant Islamists, but she turned around and
paid the fundamentalists to go east and kill suspected Kurdish rebels
(one bullet in the back of the head).  "She should be in a whorehouse
where she belongs."

<li>The government claimed that the PKK had set fire to schools in the
area, then used that as an excuse to shut them down and turned them
into barracks and bases.

<li>The police hassled him whenever he talked to foreigners.

<li>The PKK is supported by all Kurds.  The movement receives
financial support from normal city folks--maybe even from Kumar
himself--but, of course, he cannot admit to such a thing
(<em>wink</em>).

<li>The Turks are scared because they know that they have made a
mistake with the Kurds.
</ul>

I ask Kumar what his solution would be.  He answers, "Take all the
members of parliament, tie them up, then hang them, one by one."<p>

<center>* * *</center><p>

At night I go out for a stroll along the north section of the city
wall, enjoying the post-sunset cool-down of a desert climate.  Others
have the same idea, with many hunkered down in the plastic chairs of
an outdoor tea garden, mesmerized by the blaring communal TV.  I pop
in a restaurant for a hefty portion of Iskender kebap, slices of
grilled lamb topped with a tomato-based sauce; the waiter then comes
with a sizzling pan of burnt butter that, when poured on top of the
sauce, spits and splatters all over.  (He holds the lid in front of me
to shield my clothes.)  With salad and <em>ayran</em>, a salty yoghurt
drink similar to the Indian <em>lassi</em>, it costs less than $3.
Another advantage of the southeast is that prices are generally lower.
And, strangely enough, the quality of food is actually better than in
the more cosmopolitan west.  But I wonder: Am I unwittingly supporting
the PKK by eating here?<p>

<h2>Van</h2>

My final destination was Van, on the old Silk Road at the eastern end
of Turkey, the gateway to Iran.  The six-hour bus ride was a
transition from low desert to alpine, following first a tortuous route
along a deep river gorge, the water muddy and high from snowmelt, then
along the southern shore of vast Lake Van with considerable ups and
downs on the pleats of mountain ridges that ran right into the
lake.<p>

Although there were many checkpoints along the way, not every one made
us stop, and we were only boarded five times for ID checks.  However,
the cargo hold was once searched and a cardboard box was taken out to
be searched.  Its owner was frisked and questioned, and the soldiers
seemed suspicious of the books that were contained within, but they
were both returned to the bus.  The driver seemed obsessed with
setting a new time record and did not make a single bathroom stop.  We
only had a chance to pee when he finally had to pause for refueling
(even then he himself did not use the facilities).  His philosophy of
driving was that if you have a loud enough horn, others will move out
of your way.  This maxim nearly ended our trip when a dump-truck
driver either failed to hear the obnoxiously arpeggiating
diminished-triad klaxon or simply ignored it and ran us off the
pavement.<p>

Let me digress a bit now on the Turkish bus system, since normally it
works so marvelously.  First, you can get to any town in Turkey of,
say, larger than 50,000 people by bus.  There are many routes
available and the competition between the myriad bus companies is
intense.  Intercity routes use the big Mercedes-Benz models with
reserved seating, while shorter runs are made by smaller Japanese
buses.  The cost is of the order of $4 per 100 miles, and, depending
on the company, you get anything from just drinking water to cookies,
tea, and a video <em>en route</em>.  The bigger cities have bus
stations on the outskirts, which can be just a single building with a
few counters or an ultramodern terminal with electronic departure
boards and a shopping center; one had to take a city bus or
<em>dolmu&#351;</em> (a sort of shared taxi or van) to travel between
the station and the city center.  There is a tax levied on all
vehicles entering the bus station, so budget companies would sometimes
bypass it and pick up passengers only on the road.  In the business
there are four roles: the driver, the on-board attendant, the ticket
office clerk, and the tout.  The procedure goes like this: The tout,
who is repeatedly calling out the name of the destination
("Stanbulstanbulstanbulstanbulstanbullaaaahh!!"), grabs you if you
even happen to glance in his direction and drag you over to his
company office away from the competitors.  The ticket clerk then takes
your money and gives you a seat assignment with a bored look.  You
board the bus a few minutes before the departure time, a boy comes
inside to sell snacks, then the driver starts up the engine and honks
the horn before leaving.  The seat assignments are adhered to strictly
(it makes it easier for the attendant to keep track of who is getting
off where), and if there are any women who have been assigned to sit
next to a strange man, then the seating is rearranged so that she
either sits next to another woman or an empty seat.  Once the bus is
on its way, the attendant begins the service by providing a splash of
the ubiquitous lemon cologne (also available for your post-dining
pleasure at restaurants) for everyone.  Turkish buses are very sedate.
If the driver puts on a cassette, the volume is kept low; passengers
are not loud and chatty.  And, surprisingly, many buses forbid smoking
on board (although the driver is often exempt).  On the whole, a very
cheap and pleasant, if not exciting, way to travel.<p>

Lake Van is a large alkaline body of water measuring about 80 miles
east-west.  It sits at an altitude of 5700 feet and is ringed by high,
snowcapped mountains, the tallest of which is S&uuml;phan Da&#287;i, a
13,600-foot-high broad volcanic cone that dominates the northern
skyline.  A local legend places a mysterious serpentine monster in the
lake's depths, as depicted on ancient rock carvings.<p>

The city of Van lies on the eastern end of the lake.  Although its
present-day site only dates back to post-WWI, the city's earliest
known incarnation as Tushpa was the capital of the kingdom of Urartu
(or Ararat) that flourished from the thirteenth to seventh centuries
BC.  Armenians settled in the area after the fall of the Urartians and
had stayed tenaciously through subjugation by the Persians, Parthians,
Arabs, Byzantines, Seljuks, and the Ottomans, but when they sided with
the Russians during WWI, hoping to establish for themselves an
independent state, the Turks, angered by what they considered to be a
traitorous act, advanced on Van with a vengeance and reduced it to
rubble.  The old city site has been preserved from development, and
all you see now among a lumpy field of grass and weeds are two broken
minarets of sixteenth-century mosques.  The surviving Armenians were
driven out to where today's Armenia lies with its capital Yerevan,
just beyond Mt. Ararat.  Turkish relations with Armenia is extremely
strained to this day as can be noted in the contentious exhibit in the
Van Museum on the Armenian massacre of Turks that preceded their
revenge attack.  Today the majority of residents are Kurdish, and the
city acts as their market center as well as a shelter for refugees
from the Turkish military's attempts at cleaning out mountain villages
suspected of harboring PKK fighters.<p>

Located some distance away from the lake shore, the new city of Van
(population 150,000) is drab and run down, especially away from the
main roads.  Potholes, broken streetlights, and fluctuating line
voltage characterize the bad repair of its infrastructure, while gray
concrete multistory buildings that block all view of the beautiful
surrounding mountains show a lack of aesthetic concern.  Many
apartments sport satellite dishes, which, I later learned, are used
for receiving Kurdish programs from Europe.  In contrast, one can
easily imagine how pretty the old city must have been with the lake to
one side, the sheer rock formation along its northern edge with its
cuneiform inscriptions and Urartian castle, and a limpid stream
snaking down its center.<p>

Using Van as a base, I made excursions to nearby sites: southward to
G&uuml;zelsu, where another Urartian castle had been spectacularly built
into the contours of a tall, looming rock; northward to Muradiye where
the Bendimahi River fell in a roaring cascade; and westward on Lake
Van to the tiny island of Akdamar where, in the eighth century, an
Armenian prince took refuge from the onslaught of an Arab army.<p>

A craggy rock with one sector flat and the other rising steeply to a
plunging cliff, Akdamar was perhaps a third of a mile in diameter with
a maximum height of about 300 feet.  On the flat side stood an
Armenian church surrounded by blooming almond trees.  Barley grass and
chives grew on the ground.  Seagulls dove for fish from their nests in
the cliff, while hawks circled above.  In the sky, cumulus clouds
formed over the distant white mountains and were swept and stretched
like cotton candy by strong wind shears.  The alpine climate here in
May felt perfect to me.<p>

The carvings on the outside walls of the church were in excellent
shape and were impressive works of art.  It was unusual in that the
pictures had not been defaced (literally), as was normally the case in
Turkey due to the proscription in Islam against the depiction of
creatures with souls.  (This was the reason for the extremely high
level of development of the calligraphic arts and the emphasis on
abstract geometric patterns in Islamic society.)  The carvings, which
illustrated Biblical legends, were highly three-dimensional, and the
play of sunlight created illusions of motion and expression on the
characters' faces: Jonah's surprised look as he is fed to a whale
(with a lion's head and a scaly eel-body--was this the monster of Lake
Van?), Adam and Eve guiltily sharing an apple.<p>

A group of Turkish college students were there also, having a picnic
and playing soccer.  Posing for a photo, they stand
shoulder-to-shoulder and give the sign of the Gray Wolf (symbol of the
ultraright, nationalist party) with their hands.  Laughing, they start
a charcoal fire for their meat.  From the south shore of the lake I
could hear the deep rumble of a military convoy moving eastward on the
highway.<p>

<h2>"Welcome to Kurdistan!"</h2>

With the lack of tourists, Van was a friendly and generous city.  I
was treated to many glasses of tea by strangers, and had no dearth of
interesting companions with whom to hang out at night.  College and
high school students were especially game to try their English on me,
although it was usually one or two in the group who did the talking
and the rest would egg them on.<p>

Once, when I boarded a <em>dolmu&#351;</em> on the way back from the
lake, a group of animated college kids inside greeted me with a big
"Welcome to Kurdistan!" and then proceeded to reel off a litany of
insults to Turkey.  Three of them (&#350;ivan, Murad, and Fatma (not
their real names)) got off at the same stop as mine, so we walked into
the center together.  Along the way &#350;ivan bought us all ice
cream from a streetside seller who was hand-churning it inside a big
wooden tub.  Then, as we were eating our cones, the street suddenly
erupted with honking and shouting and firecrackers.  News of a PKK
victory?  No.  Van Spor, the city's soccer team, had just beaten
Samsun, 2-1.  This was a special occasion since Van Spor was in
third-to-last place and had barely averted a demotion to the second
division.  Youngsters draped a red-and-black flag of Van Spor over a
street-spanning telephone wire, and the traffic slowed and thickened.
It was too loud for a conversation so we ducked into a tea garden,
where young people were playing <em>okey</em>, a tile game reminiscent
of rummy.<p>

The trio earnestly tried to communicate to me how much they rejected
Turkish rule.  Words like "fascism" and "Hitler" were used freely.
Murad pulled out his key chain from which hung a yellow plastic Tweety
Bird.  But around its feet were painted rings of the forbidden red and
green--colors of the Kurdish flag.  On a piece of paper &#350;ivan
wrote down the numbers for me in Kurdish--<em>yek</em>, <em>dudu</em>,
<em>z&#305;</em>, <em>&ccedil;ar</em>, <em>pen&ccedil;</em>,
<em>&#351;e&#351;</em>,--an act that had been illegal until
recently.  He John Hancocked it with a flourish as if to declare his
independence.  He also drew the Kurdish flag, but this he scratched
out nervously because it was still outlawed.<p>

They kept stressing that this was Kurdistan, not Turkey.  Tansu
&Ccedil;iller was again vilified for her underhanded ways.  And, as
with Kumar in Diyarbak&#305;r, they claimed that the PKK was supported by
all Kurds.  Fatma, who hailed from the PKK stronghold of Hakkari, was
especially passionate in her defense of the rebels, and she struggled
between deep draws from a cigarette to find the right English words to
express her emotions.<p>

At 7 pm Fatma suddenly stood up to leave, as her curfew at her
grandfather's house was 6 pm.  She drew a finger across her throat to
say, "He will kill me for this."  &#350;ivan pointed to Murad and
Fatma and said that they loved each other.  Murad just grinned, but
Fatma violently protested "No, no, no!" as she left the table.<p>

<h2>A Wedding Performance</h2>

Turkey boasts an immense popular music industry that incorporates
diverse streams--art music, rural folk music, gypsy urban styles, Arab
pop, and Western rock--into slickly produced packages dispensed
through cassettes, radio programs, and video shows.  Pop stars come
and go, and often it is difficult to buy an album that dates back by
more than a couple of years.  But sadly the growth of mass-market
commercial music has been accompanied by the decline in live music,
even at festivals and public holidays that traditionally called for
live performances.  These days revelers seem content with a sound
system and several cassettes, or perhaps a large-screen TV tuned in to
Turkish MTV.  So far I had managed to intercept live vibes in only
three instances: 1. In Sel&ccedil;uk I had spotted a duo playing a
<em>d&uuml;d&uuml;k</em> (a flared-tube oboe) and a <em>davul</em> (a
double-headed drum), leading a small crowd of men down the street.
Figuring that they were drumming up action for a party, I followed
them.  But it only turned out to be the lead-up to a drinking match
between two men, and they quit playing after the game began.  2. In
Bodrum I went into a bar ("The White House") where a group of four
young bohemians were performing.  The woman singer was good, but the
conga player was stuck on one beat, even for the song in 9/8 meter,
for which he just stuck in an extra <em>pa-ta</em>.  3. In Van I was
promised "live folk music," which turned out to be a one-man Casio
band (<em>a la</em> the competitor in <em>El Mariachi</em>) in a
totally empty hotel cocktail lounge reprising nostalgic hits from the
past.  (In fairness, though, he was quite an accomplished
musician.)<p>

Thus, when I heard a very festive, very live sound emanating from a
hall on the top floor of a building as I was walking back to my hotel,
I did not hesitate to go up and investigate.  At the entrance to the
hall a security man stopped me and indicated that the event was
invitation only.  I immediately backed away and apologized, but then
he smiled and motioned "okay, okay" and pulled me inside.  It was a
wedding party with maybe about 200 people.  In the center there was a
line dance going on with separate lines for men and women.  The band
on stage was minimally instrumented (again, a <em>d&uuml;d&uuml;k</em>
and <em>davul</em>) but was impressively high decibel.  The bride and
groom sat on a dais, dressed in Western mode--white satin and lace for
her, black coat and tie for him--watching the raucous proceedings
impassively.  A video camera was set up on a tripod to record the
presumably happy event.<p>

After a short while I was invited to sit down at a table with a group
of young men.  With the language discontinuity and the loud music, not
much information was passed between us (except that they were able to
identify various American cities with their NBA teams--"Boston?
Celtics!  You know Chicago?  Michael Jordan!  The best!").  But in the
general atmosphere of cheer and good will, they decided to display
their hospitality by dragging me onto the dance floor (in my jeans and
fleece jacket) for some active cultural exchange.  Linked together by
our pinkies, we shuffle-trotted two steps forward, two steps back.
Body facing front, body facing sideways.  Fortunately it was not so
hard to imitate.  But then the lines broke up into small circles and
we had to take turns dancing solo in the center--arms stretched
straight out to the sides, feet shuffle-stepping--while the others
clapped.  I could imagine the newlyweds watching the video after their
honeymoon.  "My sweet baklava, who is that badly dressed man flailing
about like a blindfolded stork in the center of the dance circle?"
"Oh my candied marrow, his style seems to resemble that of a mountain
goat in heat--surely he must be from your side of the family?"<p>

<h2>Istanbul, 2</h2>

I found it hard to leave Van.  I had personal invitations to visit a
village and a small college.  I also wanted to keep traveling
northward along the border to Mt. Ararat and to the Black Sea, but my
five weeks were running out.  Reluctantly I boarded a Turkish Air jet
and headed back to Istanbul.<p>

This time I explored the newer sections of the city and strayed
northward along the Bosphorus.  I was now used to the city bus and
ferry system, and found it very cheap and easy to get around.  I went
shopping for a few gifts, attended two concerts, and gradually wound
down to a more reflective mood.  My armpits were still itchy.<p>

The big item in the news was the invasion of Iraqi territory by the
Turkish military in pursuit of the PKK.  Cross-border bombing missions
were being launched from Diyarbak&#305;r and the government claimed to
have killed fifty rebels in two days.  The operation had begun only
two days after I had left the Zone, and I flashed back to the military
convoys that I saw moving on the highways.  The U.S. promptly
rationalized the invasion.  State Department spokesman Nicolas Burns
stated, "You know that we believe that Turkey has a right to defend
itself from PKK terrorism.  Turkey must protect its population in
southeastern Turkey."<p>

The Kurds that I had met criticized Clinton for always supporting
Turkey.  They were polite enough not to use a stronger word than
"problem," but their message was clear: Please help put more pressure
on the Turkish government to change its Kurdish policy.  To a certain
extent this had happened already after the Gulf War highlighted the
plight of the Kurds; under pressure from the West, Turkey finally
allowed the Kurds to converse in their own language.  But the
political discourse in Turkey spiraled around the increasing
polarization between the secularists and Islamists, and the Kurdish
question was not likely to receive its due attention in the near
future.  "Kurdistan" would continue to be bracketed by those stifling,
pointed quotes, like barbed wire around an occupied land.<p>
