<h1>Detection of Meteoric Dust in the Earth's Upper Mesosphere</h1>

In 1983 a series of small rockets were launched from the Poker Flat
Rocket Range near Fairbanks, Alaska to study what has come to be
called polar mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE).  Very intense VHF radar
returns from the region had been reported by Balsley and co-workers
using the Poker Flat Radar.  The purpose of the experiment was to
understand the scattering mechanisms and to this end simple nosetip
Langmuir probes were flown on Super Arcas rockets.  We report here on
a fortuitous simultaneous radar and rocket detection of what seems to
be a meteor trail produced over the Poker Flat Rocket Range.  The two
data sets are mutually consistent and taken together suggest some very
interesting properties for the trails of large meteors.  Most notable
is the evidence that the ablated material has coagulated into
particles the order of 50 nm in radius.  This estimate is based
primarily on the fall speed deduced from both the Doppler shift of the
VHF radar signal and the time rate of change of the target as it fell
through the beam.  In addition the very existence of the radar target,
the extremely sharp edges of the trail, and the existence of electron
density structures inside the trail more than an order of magnitude
smaller than the Kolmogorov microscale, all require large charged
aerosols and a very high Schmidt number.  Curiously the environment
leading to PMSE is very similar to the properties of a large meteor
trail some minutes after it is formed.  In the former case ice
particles grow and become charged by the plasma and, when more than
half the charge is tied up on the ice, the plasma diffusion
coefficient becomes so small that structure can be supported at VHF
scattering scales.  In the late-time meteor case large aerosols
coagulate and tie up both natural charge in the plasma and the
original meteor trail electrons.  Following the work of <em>Rosinski
and Snow</em> [1961] and <em>Hunten et al.</em> [1980] we conclude
that the incident meteor was the order of 50-100 g and would have had
a visual magnitude of about -4.  Such a meteor is not uncommon but it
is remarkable indeed to have had the opportunity to study its evolution
with radar and particularly with rocket instrumentation.  Two
experimental techniques are discussed which could be used to test the
conclusions of this report and, if verified, to further study large
charged mesospheric aerosols.
