<h1>Measurements of atmospheric layers from the NASA DC-8 and P-3B
aircraft during PEM-Tropics A</h1>

Tropospheric vertical structure was analyzed using in situ
measurements of O3, CO, CH4, and H2O taken on board the NASA DC-8
aircraft during three Pacific Exploratory Missions (PEMs): PEM-West A,
September-October 1991 in the western Pacific; PEM-West B,
February-March 1994 in the western Pacific; and PEM-Tropics A,
September-October 1996 in the central and eastern Pacific.
PEM-Tropics A added measurements from the NASA P-3B aircraft.  We used
a new mode-based method to define a background against which to find
layers.  Using only O3 and H2O, we found 472 layers in PEM-Tropics A
(0.72 layers per vertical kilometer profiled), 237 layers in PEM-West
A (0.54 layers/km), and 158 layers in PEM-West B (0.41 layers/km).
Using all constituents, we found 187 layers in PEM-Tropics A (0.43
layers/km), 128 layers in PEM-West A (0.29 layers/km), and 80 layers
in PEM-West B (0.21 layers/km).  Stratospheric air, sometimes mixed
with trapped pollution, was the dominant layer source in all three
missions.  The larger number of layers per kilometer in PEM-Tropics A
was probably due to repeated profiling of several "super-layers"
visible in many of the mission lidar and potential vorticity profiles.
The thickness of the super-layers was of order 1 km, and the
horizontal extent was of order 1000 km.  We found that layers have an
important effect on the thermal structure.  An example based on
ozonesonde data from Tahiti is shown, where a dry, subsiding layer was
stabilized by much greater radiative cooling at the base than at the
top.  The stabilized layer can trap pollution and force vertical
plumes to spread into horizontal layers.<p>
