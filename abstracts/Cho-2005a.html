<h1>Extended-range signal recovery using multi-PRI transmission
for Doppler weather radars</h1>

Range-velocity (RV) ambiguity is a source of data quality degradation
common to all weather radars. Various methods have been developed in
recent years to combat this problem. For example, for the new NEXRAD
Open Radar Data Acquisition (ORDA) system, the primary focus for
range-overlay separation has been on phase-code transmission and
processing techniques. There are, however, conditions under which the
phase-code method fails to separate range-overlaid signals, e.g., when
the overlaid power ratio is too high or the Doppler spectra are too
wide. Phase-code processing also has no intrinsic capacity for
velocity dealiasing.<p>

To address these issues, Lincoln Laboratory developed an alternative
RV ambiguity mitigation scheme using multiple pulse-repetition
interval (multi-PRI) transmission and processing. The range-dealiasing
performance of the multi-PRI approach complements the capability of
the phase-code technique. It can succeed when phase-code processing
fails, and it can fail when phase-code processing succeeds, e.g., when
an overlaid patch of signal is continuous and extensive in the radial
direction. Multi-PRI also provides velocity dealiasing.<p>

However, because the multi-PRI algorithm was constructed for the
Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) with its primary mission of
near-range coverage around airports, only the capability of first-trip
protection was explicitly developed. This report extends the multi-PRI
technique to the recovery of Doppler data from other trips, out to the
long-range surveillance limit of NEXRAD. Simulated and real weather
radar data are used to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of
the technique.<p>
