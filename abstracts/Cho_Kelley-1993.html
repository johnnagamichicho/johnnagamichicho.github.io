<h1>Polar mesospheric summer radar echoes: Observations and current
theories</h1>

The remarkably strong radar echoes from the summer polar mesosphere
have been an enigma to atmospheric and radar scientists since their
discovery more than a decade ago.  Since then, more sophisticated
radar experiments and in situ rocket measurements have shed some light
on the underlying physics and chemistry, and theories have been
formulated to explain the generation of the intense radar backscatter
and the remarkable physical conditions associated with it.  First, we
review the key observations and examine the proposed theories.  We
then evaluate the progress that has been made in understanding this
phenomenon and explore its connection to global change, to the newly
recognized material referred to as a dusty plasma, and to the highest
clouds in the Earth's atmosphere.  Finally, we end with suggestions
for future research.<p>
