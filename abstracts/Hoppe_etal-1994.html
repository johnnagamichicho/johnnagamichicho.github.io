<h1>Studies of polar mesosphere
summer echoes by VHF radar and rocket probes</h1>

At radar frequencies in the range 50 MHz to 250 MHz, at times even to
over 1 GHz, strong enhancements of scattering cross section occur
between ~ 80 km and ~ 95 km altitude in summer at high latitudes.
These echoes, termed "Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes" (PMSE), have
attracted considerable experimental effort.  Observations of this
phenomenon are reviewed in the context of atmospheric dynamics and of
scattering processes.  Recent rocket and radar measurements indicate
that a partial reflection from a multitude of ion layers and
constructive interference causes at least some of the PMSE.  It is
discussed which further observations are necessary and some possible
practical consequences of PMSE are pointed out.<p>
