<h1>A comparison of PMSE
and other ground-based observations during the NLC-91 campaign</h1>

During the period July/August 1991 observations were made of polar
mesospheric summer echoes (PMSE) at 46.9 MHz and 224 MHz by the CUPRI
and EISCAT radars, respectively, at two sites in northern Scandinavia.
Those observations are here compared with observations of noctilucent
clouds, energetic particle precipition and magnetic disturbances.  The
appearance and morphology of PMSE is found to be closely correlated at
the two frequencies and the two sites, 200 km apart.  No correlation
is found between PMSE and noctilucent clouds or magnetic disturbance.
No correlation is found between energetic particle precipitation and
the appearnce of PMSE at 46.9 MHz for the whole time period.  At 224
MHz there is no evidence for a correlation before the beginning of
August and only one event suggesting a possible correlation after the
beginning of August.  A minimum in occurrence frequency for PMSE is
found between 16-21 UT (17-22 LST) which may be related to an expected
minimum in background wind strength in the time interval.<p>
