<h1>High-resolution stratospheric dynamics
measurements with the NASA/JPL Goldstone Solar System Radar</h1>

We have used, for the first time that we are aware of, the NASA/JPL
Goldstone planetary radar to study the Earth's atmosphere.  With its
high bandwidth and power, we were able to achieve a height resolution
of 20 m, which is significantly better than the usual 150-m resolution
for stratospheric radars.  Here we discuss the observation of a very
thin scattering layer that persisted over several hours at the same
height just above the tropopause.  We question the assumption of
turbulent radar scatter based on the available evidence, and also
investigate the two-minute oscillation observed in the vertical
velocity.<p>
