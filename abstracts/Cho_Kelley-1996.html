<h1>Meteoric Dust Effects on D-Region Incoherent Scatter Radar
Spectra</h1>

We extend the incoherent backscatter radar equation for the weakly
ionized, collision-dominated case to include polydisperse charged
dust, using the fluid-equation approach.  Calculations with this
equation show that the main effect of charged dust on the radar
Doppler spectrum is to narrow it, except in the case of very small,
negatively charged dust, which widens the spectrum.  The results are
encouraging for the use of incoherent scatter radar as an instrument
for meteoric dust measurement.  We also note that if the effects of
meteoric dust are not taken into account, one may get a systematic
bias in the D-region parameters deduced from the the radar spectra.
This may account for the discrepancy between observed and calculated
spectra reported in earlier papers.
