<h1>Stratosphere-troposphere ozone
exchange observed with the Indian MST radar and simultaneous
balloon borne ozonesonde</h1>

The ST mode operation of Indian MST Radar provided evidence of
multiple stable layer structures near the tropopause and also of its
"weakening" during late night hours on several occasions.  Mass
exchange can take place between troposphere and stratosphere during
the periods of such "weakening."  To examine whether there is any
transport of ozone from stratosphere to troposphere at the time of
tropopause "weakening" at tropical latitudes, simultaneous
observations were carried out using Indian MST Radar located at
Gadanki (13.50N, 79.20E) now fully operational in MST mode and
ozonesonde flights from Trivandrum (8.90N, 76.60E). Four campaigns of
simultaneous observations were conducted during January 3-8, November
9-16 and December 5-10, 1994, June 7-24, 1995.<p>

The results show occurrence of the tropopause "weakening" several
times during January 3-8, November 9-16 and December 5-10,
1994. Simultaneous observations of ozone profiles particularly on
January 7/8, November 10, 16 and December 7/8, 1994, the days of
tropopause "weakening," show the evidence of decrease in stratospheric
ozone and corresponding increase in tropospheric ozone after this
event, the total ozone remaining essentially constant on those days
with respect to other days.  But tropopause "weakening" on January 4/5,
1994 does not show any considerable change in the ozone profiles.  The
results are presented here relating the degree of tropopause
"weakening" to the extent of vertical mass exchange between
troposphere and stratosphere.<p>

An effort has been made to examine the role of horizontal advection of
ozone in increasing tropospheric ozone at the region of interest, the
geographical distribution of tropospheric ozone residual (TOR) has
been analyzed by the two data sets obtained independently from
Meteor-3 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometers (Meteor-3 TOMS) and Upper
Air Research Satellite (UARS).  Simultaneously the possibility of
horizontal transport of ozone from the surroundings of Tirupati and
Trivandrum in increasing tropospheric ozone due to synoptic scale
circulation has also been verified by close inspection of synoptic
weather charts at 1000, 700, 500 and 300 hPa obtained from NCMRWF GCM
model at 00 UTC and 12 UTC of January 7 and 00 UTC and 12 UTC of
January 8, 1994.<p>
