<h1>Tropospheric ozone layers observed during PEM-Tropics B</h1>

In this paper we analyze distinct layers seen in the tropospheric
ozone and water vapor profiles taken during NASA's Global Tropospheric
Experiment (GTE) Pacific Exploratory Mission in the Tropical Pacific
(PEM-Tropics) Phase B campaign.  In summary, fewer layers were
observed in this campaign than during the PEM-Tropics A campaign.
However, of those layers found, there were relatively more
ozone-rich-water-vapor-poor layers (68% versus 52%).  The percentage
of the sampled troposphere occupied by layers during PEM-Tropics B was
less than half of that found during PEM-Tropics A (8% versus 20%).
The differences between these two campaigns suggest a seasonal
variation in the occurrence of layers.  This is confirmed using
measurements made by the Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes
(SHADOZ) network.<p>
