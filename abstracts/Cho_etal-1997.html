<h1>Aspect Sensitivity and Orientation of Polar Summer Mesospheric
Radar Scattering Layers: A Case Study</h1>

We introduce an optimization procedure for aspect sensitivity
calculations for Doppler-beam-swinging (DBS) radar data.  Furthermore,
we define the tropogram, a measure of the backscatter anisotropy, and
the clinogram, a vector field plot of the tilt directions of
aspect-sensitive scattering layers.  We apply these methods to polar
mesospheric summer echo data and demonstrate their effectiveness and
utility.  We conclude that even with the optimization procedure
extraction of unambiguous aspect sensitivity information is
problematic for DBS systems, especially for those with broad oblique
beams.  On the other hand, the clinogram holds promise as a further
aid in the study of wave dynamics using DBS radar data.<p>
