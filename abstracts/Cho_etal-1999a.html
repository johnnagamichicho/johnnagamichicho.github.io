<h1>Trace gas study accumulates 40 million frequent-flyer miles for
science</h1>

At any given moment about 4000 commercial aircraft are flying over the
Earth.  To an atmospheric scientist they constitute a potentially vast
array of in situ measurement platforms, an obvious source of
high-resolution upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UT/LS) trace gas
data that could not be obtained on such a continuous basis in any other
way, especially over the oceans.

The number of flights has been steadily growing, and the long-term
outlook for continued "funding" looks excellent given the penchant for
humans to travel around the world.  And yet, to date, there have been
few attempts to tap this resource for atmospheric chemistry studies. One
study, however, has chalked up 40 million miles over the past five
years.<p>

Using commercial airliners to measure trace gases in the atmosphere is a
well-justified self-monitoring activity, since engine exhaust is
constantly injecting material into the flight corridors.  Although the
total amount is not great (2 to 3% of all anthropogenic atmospheric
pollution), the UT/LS region is sensitive to aircraft emission in
several ways. Nitrogen oxides, CO, and hydrocarbons through
photochemical reactions may increase the amount of tropospheric ozone,
which is a greenhouse gas; and water vapor, soot, and sulfur oxides can
increase contrail clouds and aerosols that may modify UT/LS radiative
forcing and the global temperature.<p>

With air traffic expected to double in the next 10 to 15 years,
aviation effects on the atmosphere can only be expected to increase as
well. To take advantage of this existing atmospheric sampling
infrastructure, a program to measure ozone and water vapor by Airbus
in-service aircraft (MOZAIC) was launched in January 1993 [<em>Marenco
et al.</em>, 1998].  So far MOZAIC has recorded over 10,300 flights
totaling 74,000 hours and 40 million miles.  Initial scientific
results were published in a special section of the <em>Journal of
Geophysical Research</em> in 1998 (vol. 103, no.  D19) as well as in
other journals, including two papers in <em>Nature</em>.<p>
