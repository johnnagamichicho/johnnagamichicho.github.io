<h1>Aircraft observations of boundary layer turbulence:
Intermittency and the cascade of energy and passive scalar variance</h1>

We analyze boundary-layer velocity and temperature measurements
acquired by aircraft at 22 Hz.  The calculated longitudinal velocity
third-order structure function yields approximate agreement with
Kolmogorov's four-fifths law for the scale range ~ 10-100 m with a
downscale energy flux of ~ 4 x 10<sup>-5</sup>
m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>3</sup>.  For scales greater than ~ 10 km the sign
is reversed, implying an inverse energy cascade with an estimated flux
of ~ 10<sup>-5</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>3</sup> associated with 2D
stratified turbulence.  The mixed structure function of longitudinal
velocity and squared temperature increment follows Yaglom's
four-thirds law in the same scale range, yielding an estimated
downscale temperature variance flux of ~ 5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>
K<sup>2</sup>/s.  Analysis of higher-order structure functions yields
anomalous scaling for both velocity and temperature.  The scaling also
reveals second-order multifractal phase transitions for both velocity
and temperature data.  Above the transition moments, asymptotes
varying with the number of realizations argue against the log-Poisson
model.  The log-L&eacute;vy model is better able to explain the
observed characteristics.<p>
