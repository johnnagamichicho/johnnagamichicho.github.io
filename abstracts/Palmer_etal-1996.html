<h1>A new spatial interferometry capability using the Arecibo 430 MHz radar</h1>

This note describes the new spatial interferometry (SI) capability of
the 430 MHz radar system of the Arecibo Observatory (AO).  Three
limitations exist when the 430 MHz radar is used for observations in
the tropo- and stratospheric region.  First, the AO radar currently
has a lower height limitation of approximately 6 km, due to the
existing transmit/receive switch.  Second, fading ground clutter
limits the useful data which can be obtained and complicates the
analysis.  Third, the large mass of the feed system, which slows down
beam steering, reduces the temporal resolution of any measurements
requiring multiple beam positions.  For these reasons, an SI system
has been developed which will be shown to reduce these limitations.  A
brief description of the hardware is provided and preliminary data are
presented.
