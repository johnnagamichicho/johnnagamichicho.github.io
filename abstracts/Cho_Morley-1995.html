<h1>PMSE dependence on long-period vertical motions</h1>

We analyze the temporal relationship between PMSE (polar mesosphere
summer echoes) and long-period vertical motions using the Poker Flat,
Alaska radar data.  The results show that the vertical velocity leads
PMSE by 90 to 180 deg with an upward trend in phase with increasing
frequency.  We show that this is consistent with the current PMSE
theories which depend primarily upon the presence of charged ice
aerosols for the enhancement of radar scatter.<p>
