<h1>Tropopause structure and its "weakening" as seen by Indian MST radar</h1>

This paper aims at the detection of finer structure of tropopause
including "weakening" by Indian MST radar aided with temperature
profile.  Four campaigns have been carried out using the Indian MST
radar at Gadanki near Tirupati (13.5 deg N, 79.2 deg E) during January
3-8, November 9-16 and December 5-10, 1994, June 7-24, 1995.  The
results show occurrence of the tropopause "weakening" for several
times during January 3-8, November 9-16 and December 5-10, 1994.  But
the results during 3-8 January, 1994 are presented here.  In addition,
a plausible mechanism which can qualitatively account for the cause of
tropopause "weakening" has been addressed here.<p>
