<h1>General characteristics of
tropospheric trace constituent layers observed in the MOZAIC
program</h1>

We present a statistical study on tropospheric layers as allowed by
the most extensive ozone and water vapor data base up to now
available.  Considering O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O deviations
from an automatically calculated background we define four types of
layers.  These tropospheric layers are a common feature with the
percentage of the troposphere occupied by such layers varying from 7%
to 33% depending on the region and the season.  Most of the layers are
found between 4 and 8 km altitude and the median thickness is about
500 m.  At northern mid-latitudes we find four times more layers in
summer than in winter, while in tropical Asia we observe a spring
maximum in the occurrence of the layers.  The most abundant layer type
everywhere is O<sub>3</sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>O- and corresponds to the
signature of stratospheric intrusions or continental pollution.  This
suggests that stratosphere-troposphere exchanges or at least their
influence are not negligible in summer at mid-latitudes or in the
tropics.  A complete understanding of the layers could lead to a
better empirical assessment of the different tropospheric ozone
sources and to an assessment of the potential vorticity fluxes in the
troposphere.<p>
