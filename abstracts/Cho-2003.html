<h1>Evaluation of TDWR range-velocity ambiguity mitigation
techniques</h1>

Range and velocity ambiguities pose significant data quality
challenges for the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR).  For typical
pulse repetition frequenceis (PRFs) of 1-2 kHz, the radar is subject
to both range-ambiguous precipitation returns and velocity aliasing.
Experience shows that these are a major contributor to failures of the
system's wind shear detection algorithms.  Here we evaluate the degree
of mitigation offered by existing phase diversity methods to these
problems.  Using optimized processing techniques, we analyze the
performance of two particular phase codes that are best suited for
application to TDWRs--random and SZ(8/64) [<em>Sachidananda and
Zrnic</em>, 1999]--in the protection of weak-trip power, velocity, and
spectral width estimates.  Results from both simulated and real
weather data indicate that the SZ(8/64) code generally outperforms the
random code, except for protection of 1st trip from 5th trip
interference.  However, the SZ code estimates require a priori
knowledge of out-of-trip spectral widths for censoring.  This
information cannot be provided adequately by a separate scan with a
pulse repetition frequency (PRF) low enough to unambiguously cover the
entire range of detectable weather, because then the upper limit of
measurable spectral width is only about 2 m/s.  For this reason we
conclude that SZ phase codes are not appropriate for TDWR use.<p>

For velocity ambiguity resolution, the random phase code could be
transmitted at two PRFs on alternating dwells.  Assuming the velocity
changes little between two consecutive dwells, a Chinese remainder
type of approach can be used to dealias the velocities.  Strong ground
clutter at close range, however, disables this scheme for gates at the
beginning of the 2nd trip of the higher PRF.<p>

We offer an alternative scheme for range-velocity ambiguity
mitigation: multistaggered pulse processing (MSPP).  Yielding
excellent velocity dealiasing capabilities, the MSPP method should
also provide protection from patchy, small-scale out-of-trip weather.<p>

To obtain maximum performance in both range and velocity dealiasing,
we suggest that information from the initial low-PRF scan be used to
decide the best waveform to transmit in the following scan-random
phase code with alternating-dwell PRFs or MSPP.  Such an adaptive
approach presages future developments in weather radar, for example
electronically scanned arrays allow selective probing of relevant
weather events.<p>
