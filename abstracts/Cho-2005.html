<h1>Multi-PRI signal processing for the Terminal Doppler Weather
Radar.  Part II: Range-velocity ambiguity mitigation</h1>

Multiple pulse-repetition interval (multi-PRI) transmission is part of
an adaptive signal transmission and processing algorithm being
developed to combat range-velocity (RV) ambiguity for the Terminal
Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR).  In Part I, an adaptive clutter
filtering procedure that yields low biases in the moments estimates
was presented.  In Part II, algorithms for simultaneously providing
range-overlay protection and velocity dealiasing using multi-PRI
signal transmission and processing are presented.  The effectiveness
of the multi-PRI RV ambiguity mitigation scheme is demonstrated using
simulated and real weather radar data, with excellent results.
Combined with the adaptive clutter filter, this technique will be used
within the larger context of an adaptive signal transmission and
processing scheme in which phase-code processing will be a
complementary alternative.<p>
