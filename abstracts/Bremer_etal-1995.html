<h1>PMSE observations with EISCAT during summer 1991</h1>

Polar mesosphere summer echoes (PMSE) have been observed with the
European incoherent scatter radar (EISCAT) operating at 224 MHz during
summer 1991.  The mean height of PMSE was about 85 km during day-time
and about 87 km during night-time with a markedly enhanced occurrence
probability during day-time.  The probability of occurrence of PMSE is
higher during geomagnetically quiet than during disturbed periods.
There are some indications of a PMSE modulation by atmospheric gravity
waves a s well as 2d-waves.  Comparisons of PMSE structures derived
from EISCAT 224-MHz and CUPRI 46.9-MHz radar observations demonstrate
common features as well as marked differences.<p>
