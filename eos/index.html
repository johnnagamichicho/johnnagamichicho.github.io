<h1>Trace Gas Study Accumulates 40 Million Frequent-Flyer Miles for Science</h1>

At any given moment about 4000 commercial aircraft are flying over the
Earth.  To an atmospheric scientist they constitute a potentially vast
array of in situ measurement platforms, an obvious source of
high-resolution upper tropospheric/lower stratospheric (UT/LS) trace gas
data that could not be obtained on such a continuous basis in any other
way, especially over the oceans.<p>

The number of flights has been steadily growing, and the long-term
outlook for continued "funding" looks excellent given the penchant for
humans to travel around the world.  And yet, to date, there have been
few attempts to tap this resource for atmospheric chemistry studies. One
study, however, has chalked up 40 million miles over the past five
years.<p>

Using commercial airliners to measure trace gases in the atmosphere is a
well-justified self-monitoring activity, since engine exhaust is
constantly injecting material into the flight corridors.  Although the
total amount is not great (2 to 3% of all anthropogenic atmospheric
pollution), the UT/LS region is sensitive to aircraft emission in
several ways. Nitrogen oxides, CO, and hydrocarbons through
photochemical reactions may increase the amount of tropospheric ozone,
which is a greenhouse gas; and water vapor, soot, and sulfur oxides can
increase contrail clouds and aerosols that may modify UT/LS radiative
forcing and the global temperature.<p>

With air traffic expected to double in the next 10 to 15 years,
aviation effects on the atmosphere can only be expected to increase as
well. To take advantage of this existing atmospheric sampling
infrastructure, a program to measure ozone and water vapor by Airbus
in-service aircraft (MOZAIC) was launched in January 1993 <a
href="#marenco">[Marenco et al., 1998]</a>.  So far MOZAIC has
recorded over 10,300 flights totaling 74,000 hours and 40 million
miles.  Initial scientific results were published in a special section
of the <em>Journal of Geophysical Research</em> in 1998 (vol. 103, no.
D19) as well as in other journals, including two papers in
<em>Nature</em>.<p>

<h2>First Project in 1968</h2>

The first project to use in-service aircraft for trace constituent
data collection took place in 1968 with carbon monoxide observations
made from Lufthansa B-707 airliners <a href="#seiler">[Seiler and
Junge, 1970]</a>.  From the vertical CO gradient observed above the
tropopause, the researchers estimated the size of the stratospheric CO
sink.  (The same group employed a manned laboratory inside a container
on 10 German Cargo Services flights between 1981 and 1987 to measure
CO.)<p>

Also, under the tropospheric ozone (TROZ) campaign, the meridional
distribution of ozone was studied using 37 commercial flights between
northern Europe and South Africa during 1970-1974. That study
concluded that upper tropospheric ozone distribution was determined
primarily by input from the stratosphere <a href="#fabian">[Fabian and
Pruchniewicz, 1977]</a>.<p>

NASA's global atmospheric sampling program (GASP) was the first
continuous, long-term effort to piggyback trace gas measuring
instruments on commercial jetliners. Four B-747s (two Pan American,
one United, and one Qantas) were equipped with instruments to
routinely measure ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapor, aerosols,
temperature, and horizontal winds [see, e.g., <a
href="#nastrom">Nastrom, 1979</a>].<p>

The program lasted from 1975 to 1979 with over 6900 flights (80%
between 30 deg N and 55 deg N) recorded. Highlights included estimates
of the vertical and horizontal flux of ozone near the tropopause,
interhemispheric transport deduced from CO results, the discovery of
upper tropospheric low-ozone regions caused by Walker circulation
transport from the western Pacific boundary layer, the refutation of
the mesoscale kinetic energy gap, and demonstration of terrain effects
on flight-level mesoscale wind variability.<p>

Now, after nearly 2 decades, commercial airliners are again being used
for collecting trace gas data.  Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and
methane were measured routinely between April 1993 and July 1996 on a
Japan Airlines B-747 flying between Japan and Australia <a
href="#matsueda">[Matsueda et al., 1998]</a>.  Twelve air samples were
taken during each flight and analyzed later in a laboratory.  Results
showed that the seasonal cycles of these trace gases differ
significantly between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and that
southern African or South American biomass burning signatures appear
in the upper troposphere over Australia in the spring.<p>

Another study, the nitrogen oxides and ozone measurements along air
routes (NOXAR) investigation, was conducted from May 1995 to May 1996.
Instruments were operated on 540 Swissair B-747 flights in the
Northern Hemisphere, with data recorded every 3 s for a horizontal
resolution of about 750 m at cruise altitude.  One of the initial
major findings of NOXAR was the detection of large-scale (100-1300 km)
nitrogen oxide plumes in the upper troposphere that were produced by
continental pollution or lightning <a href="#brunner">[Brunner et al.,
1998]</a>.  The elevated levels of ozone within the plumes,
particularly in the summer, suggested an enhancement in photochemical
ozone production because of the high nitrogen oxide concentration.<p>

Although GASP generated a formidable amount of data on the UT/LS region,
data quality and resolution issues hindered their full use for
scientific purposes, especially for the trace gases.  For most flights
the data were collected only at 5-min intervals, there were instrumental
problems with the CO instrument due to water condensation, and there
were uncertainties about the water vapor data quality.  Moreover, these
experiments were performed during a time when theories on photochemical
formation of ozone were just developing and their significance was not
yet universally recognized.<p>

<h2>Quasiglobal Climatology</h2>

Sensing the need for a new GASP-like program that utilized updated
technology, European scientists in collaboration with Airbus Industrie
(and its partners), Air France, Austrian Airlines, Lufthansa, and Sabena
initiated the MOZAIC program in January 1993.  They hoped to establish a
quasiglobal climatology of the large-scale distributions of ozone and
water vapor in the UT/LS region and to determine the vertical and
temporal distributions of ozone and water vapor at various airport
locations around the world. They also wanted to investigate the seasonal
and geographical variations of the measured distributions in relation to
their natural and anthropogenic sources, stratosphere-troposphere
exchanges, and horizontal and vertical air circulations. The scientists
hoped as well to validate and improve the current three-dimensional (3D)
chemistry and transport models used to evaluate the present and future
impact of human activity by comparison between MOZAIC climatologies and
model outputs, with particular emphasis on subsonic aircraft emissions.<p>

MOZAIC's modus operandi was to keep the instrument package small and
light to minimize the cost load for the carriers.  For the first phase,
ozone, water vapor, and temperature probes were integrated into a rack
that was roughly equivalent to the space and weight of one passenger
plus baggage (full weight 117 kg).  The package was installed in the
avionic compartment below the cockpit, with the intake tubes mounted on
the fuselage 7 m back from the aircraft's nose.  The system operates
automatically without help from the flight crew.  However, the airline
maintenance crew does check for malfunctions during routine stopovers.
Time, position, pressure, airplane speed, and horizontal wind data are
obtained from the aircraft's air data computer.  All the data are
recorded at 4-s intervals from takeoff to landing.<p>

The processed and validated data are stored in a database at Centre
National de Recherche M&eacute;t&eacute;orologique, Toulouse, operated
by M&eacute;t&eacute;o-France.  To aid in data interpretation, daily
maps of meteorological and satellite data are also archived. Potential
vorticity and tropopause characteristics interpolated every minute
along each aircraft trajectory also are available.  Booklets
containing data plots from each flight and daily meteorological fields
are available free of charge to MOZAIC coinvestigators (see end of
article on how to become a coinvestigator).<p>

global sectors are also displayed.</small><p>

The global distribution of the MOZAIC flight routes is shown in Figure
1.  Clearly the Atlantic Ocean sector is well covered, but even the 8%
for Africa represents over 820 flights, a vast improvement in coverage
over TROZ or GASP for that region.  Figure 2 shows example data from a
flight at cruise altitude.  On this flight, the aircraft clearly went
through stratospheric air during three intervals when ozone and
potential temperature were very high and humidity was extremely low.
Also the horizontal winds changed markedly at times when the
troposphere-stratosphere transitions took place.<p>

<h2>Initial Results Successful</h2>

MOZAIC has certainly been successful in establishing a climatology of
ozone in the UT/LS region over a wide range of latitudes and longitudes
(see Figure 3; relative humidity climatology is also displayed).  This
climatology was established for five flight levels between 9 and 12 km
altitude.  To distinguish between stratospheric (ozone-rich) and
tropospheric (ozone-poor) air, a threshold of 100 ppbv of ozone was used
in a first attempt.  An analysis of the seasonal variations in both the
UT and LS regions was made possible in this way, and the results
highlighted the spring maximum/winter minimum in stratospheric air and
the summer maximum/fall minimum in tropospheric air.<p>

<small>Figure 3.  Geographical and seasonal distributions in ozone concentration
(top) and relative humidity (bottom) at the 238-hPa pressure flight
level (10.6 km) from MOZAIC data collected between September 1994 and
August 1996 (autumn, S-O-N; winter, D-J-F; spring, M-A-M; summer,
J-J-A).  The horizontal resolution of the plotted data is 2.5
degs.</small><p>
</center>

At northern mid-latitudes, the distribution of ozone was related to the
intensities of dynamic (tropopause variations, stratosphere/troposphere
exchanges, variations of the polar front, and the position of
ridge/trough pressure systems) and photochemical processes.  At tropical
latitudes, the MOZAIC climatology showed the influences of active
photochemical processes, deep convection, and biomass burning emissions
<a href="#thouret">[Thouret et al., 1998]</a>.<p>

This climatology is important for understanding dynamic and chemical
processes involved in the upper tropospheric ozone distribution, for 3D
model validations (only MOZAIC data are available at these altitudes
with such wide spatial coverage), for comparisons with other ozone
measurements (ozone soundings, other airborne programs, satellite data),
and for estimation of flight times within the stratosphere.  The
horizontal wind and temperature fluctuation data can also be used to
study gravity waves and 2D turbulence and the atmospheric kinetic energy
spectrum in general.<p>

The comparison between the 2-year MOZAIC ozone climatology (1994-1996)
and the long series of some stations from the ozone sounding network has
shown that they were in rather good agreement, despite the different
natures of the programs.  Mean concentrations derived from ozonesonde
series are about 3 to 13% higher that those obtained by MOZAIC in the
free troposphere; these differences are within the range of
uncertainties of the two techniques.<p>

Recent modeling studies have demonstrated that aircraft contrails have
the potential for climate forcing.  However, a quantitative assessment
has been difficult because contrail parameterization has been
problematic.  The MOZAIC humidity and temperature fluctuation data
have helped in this regard.  The fluctuation distributions together
with local criteria for the formation and persistence of contrails
have allowed calculation of the maximum fractional coverage of
contrails within a model grid <a href="#gierens">[Gierens et al.,
1997]</a>.<p>

The study also showed that large-scale distributions of relative
humidity and temperature fluctuations could not be modeled as
Gaussians.  Instead, they manifested long tails that were closer to
Lorentzian in form.<p>

Ozone measurements during cross-equatorial MOZAIC flights have
confirmed the dynamical barrier effect of the subtropical tropopause
to exchanges between the subtropical stratosphere and the tropical
troposphere.  However, it seems that the barrier could be leaky at
small scales (<100 km) as ozone transients are observed south of the
subtropical jet in the upper equatorial troposphere <a
href="#suhre">[Suhre et al., 1997]</a>.<p>

<h2>Dramatic Expansion of Coverage</h2>

Because every flight includes a takeoff and a landing, vertical profiles
of the measured quantities are produced over the departure and arrival
airports; an example is shown in Figure 4.  Tropospheric layers of ozone
and other trace gases have been observed and analyzed using data from
research aircraft missions, but MOZAIC has dramatically expanded the
global and seasonal coverage.  Layers can be categorized according to
the various combinations of high or low
anomalies in the trace gas levels with respect to the background
concentrations.  For example, with two constituents, ozone and water
vapor, there would be four types: low ozone/low humidity, low ozone/high
humidity, high ozone/low humidity, and high ozone/high humidity.<p>

<small>Figure 4.  Vertical profiles of ozone, relative humidity, potential
temperature, and horizontal winds obtained during descent into
Frankfurt, Germany.  Note the high-ozone, low-humidity layer at 5 km,
which was also associated with enhanced static stability and wind
shear.  Most likely it originated in the stratosphere.</small><p>
</center>

<a href="#newell">Newell et al. [1999]</a> found from MOZAIC data that
approximately half of all layers everywhere (including the tropics)
were of the high ozone/low humidity type (Figure 4).  Most likely this
type of layer originates in the stratosphere (since the stratosphere
has much higher ozone levels and is much dryer than the troposphere)
and thus has implications for stratosphere-troposphere
exchange. However, to really confirm the source of this and other
types of layers, one needs to measure other marker species such as CO
and examine the 3D dynamical context in which the layer was formed and
advected.  This kind of detailed study is being performed using
dedicated research aircraft (NASA's ongoing Pacific Exploratory
Mission (PEM); see <a href="#newell">Newell et al.  [1999]</a> for
references).<p>

The high quality and fine time resolution of the MOZAIC ozone data
allow the study of small-scale features.  For example,
an important characteristic of the layers is that they are sometimes as
thin as a few hundred meters.  Chemical reaction rates can be highly
nonlinear, so the output of an averaged input quantity is not
necessarily equal to the averaged output of multiple inputs at finer
resolution.  Such resolution dependency has shown up quite strongly in
model calculations of chemical ozone loss.  Current models are unable to
resolve these thin layers, which places a fundamental limit on their
accuracy.  Thin humidity layers can also have local radiative forcing
effects.  Dry layers are self-stabilizing; wet layers are
destabilizing.  Patches of clear-air turbulence may be generated by such
unstable layers.<p>

<h2>New Phase Proposed</h2>

MOZAIC has gone through two phases and, to extend the program several
years more, a third phase has been proposed to the Fifth Framework
Program of the European Communities for 2000-2002.  MOZAIC-III plans
to add CO, NO<em>y</em>, aerosols, vertical wind velocity, and
turbulence measurements.<p>

These new measurements will considerably enhance the possibilities of
interpretations in the UT/LS. Possible will be evaluation of
convective transport of pollutants from the continental boundary layer
into the upper troposphere; climatology of nitrogen species;
discrimination between stratospheric and tropospheric air (combined
with ozone, water vapor, and potential vorticity criteria); better
identification of tropospheric layer characteristics based on criteria
similar to those used for PEM data; better validation of 3D chemical
and transport models; and large-scale distributions of aerosols and
turbulent structure of the atmosphere.  The extension of ozone and
water vapor time series also will offer the possibility to study
trends and interannual variabilities in the UT/LS.<p>

Besides meeting its own programmatic scientific goals, it is MOZAIC's
philosophy to maximize the scientific use of its database.  A huge
reservoir of high quality observations, the database is indeed of
valuable interest for the international scientific community. Powerful
tools have been developed to allow easy access and fast recovery of the
data by authorized users via ftp and the Web.<p>

Interested scientists are encouraged to become coinvestigators in the
program by developing collaborations with MOZAIC participants under
rather flexible conditions -- submission of a scientific project and
signing of the MOZAIC Data Protocol.  Information on the program and
