<a name="kecapi"></a>
<b>Bale Seni Megasari</b><br>
<em>Java: Kecapi Suling</em><br>
<a href="mailto:playasound@wanadoo.fr">Playa Sound</a><p>

A kecapi is a Javanese plucked zither of which there are several
types, and a suling is a bamboo flute.  Aside from the main use of
kecapi instead of a gamelan, the pieces on this album follow the
soothing, meadering outlines of degung music.  The overall timbre of
the string accompaniment is mellower than for an all-gong orchestra,
and the "out of tune" octaves in the bass zither generate an
intriguing beating effect.  Unfortunately, the recording has both tape
hiss and poor high-frequency response that muffle the sound.  At times
the rhythmic impetus of the ensemble stumbles, as if lethargy had
momentarily crept in.  The scant liner notes are also a minus.<p>

<b>Eyuphuro</b><br>
<em>Yellela</em><br>
<a href="http://www.worldmusic.net">World Music Network</a><p>

It's been a good season for African musicians making their comeback
after years of absence from touring and recording.  First it was Samba
Mapangala coming alive with the celebratory <em>Ujumbe</em>; now
Eyuphuro has returned with the kaleidoscopic <em>Yellela</em>.
Despite its folk origins, the music assembled here is varied and, in
parts, quite sophisticated.  Underpinning it all is the plaintive
contralto of Zena Bacar, with her trademark catch-in-the-throat
inflections, which is showcased in the yearning cut "Othiawene" ("My
Faraway Love").  There are echoes of the Caribbean in the Cuban swing
of the aforementioned song as well as in the calypsonian vocal lilt of
"Ayaka" ("My Husband"), while Mahamudo Selimane's multitracked
minor-key electric guitar lines invoke a melancholy Iberian
sensibility.  A rolling 6/8 beat is used on some cuts, which, together
with the close third harmonies provided by Issufo Manuel (who composed
half the songs), calls to mind Malagasy music.  The lyrics of Manuel
lament the problems afflicting much of Africa, while Bacar delivers
stinging feminist messages in hers.  The only glitch here is the
severe intonation problem of the sax solo on "Ethuila Exeni"--the
producer should have caught that one.  Otherwise, this is a very fine
and thoughtful album.<p>

<a name="franco"></a>
<b>Franco</b><br>
<em>The Rough Guide to Franco</em><br>
<a href="http://www.worldmusic.net">World Music Network</a><p>

The ever-expanding anthology series by the Rough Guide kicks off its
single-artist category with the undisputed giant of African pop,
Franco.  Fortunately, they commissioned Graeme Ewens, biographer of
Franco, to put it together, and we are treated to a well-considered
collection of Francophilia.  The cuts are chosen for their historical
context (as well as their popularity), with succinct liner notes to
help us connect the dots.  The first cut from 1956 shows off Franco's
already solid guitar work at age 17, then we are taken past such
landmarks as "Infidelite Mado" and "Mario," only to arrive at the
cautionary 1987 AIDS song "Attention na SIDA," a consciousness that,
alas, came too late for Franco himself, who died in 1989.  This album
is an excellent starting point for anyone wishing to discover the
musical legacy that Franco left for the world.<p>

<a name="marija"></a>
<b>Gamana</b><br>
<em>Le Marija</em><br>
<a href="http://www.lyrichord.com">Lyrichord</a><p>

A very "conscious" band with a theme of environmentalism and
historical preservation.  Perhaps it's partly the studio recording,
but there seems to be a certain distance between the musicians and the
music, what one might call the folklorist's approach to song writing
and playing.  The sound is also dominated by the guitar of the leader,
Rola.  Some of the expansive acoustic guitar solos reminded me of
Egberto Gismonti.  If you are hoping for something with one of those
infectious Malagasy rhythms that would get you up on your feet and
dancing, this is not the album.<p>

<a name="ghazal"></a>
<b>Ghazal</b><br>
<em>Moon Rise Over the Silk Road</em><br>
<a href="http://www.shanachie.com">Shanachie</a><p>

Ghazal is an ongoing collaboration between Kayhan Kalhor, an Iranian
<em>kamancheh</em> (a vertical, four-string fiddle) virtuoso, and
Shujaat Husain Khan, a sitar master.  This is Ghazal's third album in
what has turned out to be an entirely successful fusion of two ancient
classical musics: Persian and Hindustani (north Indian).  By
successful I mean that the casual listener not necessarily well-versed
in the subtleties of either tradition can appreciate and enjoy the
results.  On one hand, the two streams, although developed separately
in parallel, have a great common basis in the primacy of
improvisation, leading to a very natural collaborative framework.  On
the other hand, the distinct differences in the built-up repertoire of
raga and other prescribed patterns call for a common denominator,
which, perhaps, lead to a performance that is more accessible to the
ears from other traditions.  No doubt, though, it is the particular
skills of these two great players (accompanied by Swapan Chaudhuri, a
tabla expert) and their growing familiarity with each other that has
produced such satisfying results.  Track 1, "Fire in my Heart," is
especially evocative of the Silk Road of the CD title, with a loping
rhythm suggestive of a moving caravan, the intensity slowly increasing
around a simple melodic motif, building up to a climax driven by some
passion that is driving one from point A to B in the geography of
desire.<p>

<a name="younggrass"></a>
<b>Huun-Huur-Tu</b><br>
<em>Where Young Grass Grows</em><br>
<a href="http://www.shanachie.com">Shanachie</a><p>

Huun-Huur-Tu is making the inevitable move toward globalization that
comes with worldwide touring and collaboration with foreign musicians,
but so far they have managed to retain their own unique identity and
remain firmly rooted in Tuvan traditional sounds.  By now the novel
aspects of multitonal throat singing do not need to be featured to
help sell their work.  Compared to their previous albums there is a
richer harmonic (in the traditional Western sense) texture, and such
Tuvan anomalies as the harp, Scottish pipes, and synthesizer make
their appearance.  However, they remain unobtrusively in the
background (the synthesizer is used to generate a virtual wind storm),
and one gets the sense that the quartet has a mature, rooted sense of
where they want to go with their music.  The highlight for me, though,
are the excerpts of field recordings made by ethnomusicologist Ted
Levin (Smithsonian Folkways's <em>Tuva, Among The Spirits</em>,
reviewed below) of throat-singing while on horseback.  The music,
restored to its physical context, suddenly makes so much more sense.<p>

<a name="kalindi"></a>
<b>Kalindi-Ka</b><br>
<em>Yo</em><br>
<a href="http://www.playasound.com">Playasound</a><p>

A group leader since forming Katoure in 1987, Marie-Line Dahomay, a
vital voice from Guadeloupe, brings us back-to-roots <em>gwo ka</em>
with her new outfit, Kalindi-Ka.  <em>Gwo ka</em>, along with the
Martinican <em>chouval bwa</em>, is the musical basis on which the
globally popular zouk developed.  Traditionally led by male singers,
Dahomay has claimed <em>gwo ka</em> as her own; she and her
call-and-response female chorus bring to us the joys and sorrows of
being a woman in the Antilles.  A festival music from the hills of
Guadeloupe, <em>gwo ka</em> is a participatory voice-and-drum music
with rich, layered harmonies reminiscent of South African
<em>iscathamiya</em> combined with West African style polyrhythmic
drumming.  Dahomay (the name itself evocative of Mother Africa) has a
mature, commanding voice with a tempering vibrato that effectively
leads and anchors the group's sound.  There is more than <em>gwo
ka</em> here, as the album contains cuts ranging from Dahomay
plaintively singing solo (accompanying herself on the <em>ektara</em>,
an Indian one-stringed instrument) to a piece that incorporates a
jazzy muted trumpet.  The traditional <em>ka</em> drum is joined on
some numbers by djembe, conga, and bata for a more pan-Afro-diaspora
feel.  The studio reverb distances the CD from the context of
festival, and at 43 minutes it is on the short side, but overall it is
one that I can recommend highly, especially to those who want to
explore the roots of zouk.<p>

<a name="exsina"></a>
<b>Alioune Kass&eacute;</b><br>
<em>Exsina</em><br>
<a href="http://worldmusic.com/tinder">Tinder</a><p>

I was pleasantly surprised by this CD.  Judging from the cover art,
which is an obvious echo of Etoile de Dakar's <em>Thiopathioly</em>'s
wooden-skiff-on-beach scene, one might have expected a Youssou N'Dour
copycat attempt.  True, Kass&eacute;'s voice is a dead ringer for
N'Dour's in the upper registers, and the synth-padded mbalax numbers
are reminiscent of Super Etoile de Dakar after <em>Set</em>.  However,
there are other influences discernible in the sound such as the
melodicity of Xalam and the scurrying horn breaks of early Dande
Lenol.  There's just enough originality to make Kass&eacute; sound not
quite like anyone else, and the album is quite enjoyable, but he has
yet to achieve a truly distinctive sound to call his own.  Actually
the CD is a bit too polished--I'd like to see him in concert to see if
he stretches out more with his crackling percussion players in front
of an audience.<p>

<a name="musta"></a>
<b>Sanna Kurki-Suonio</b><br>
<em>Musta</em><br>
<a href="http://www.noside.com">Northside</a><p>

The first solo outing by Hedningarna's Finnish female singer and
kantele player.  Those familiar with Hedningarna will recognize her
laser-steady, vibratoless voice, and the preoccupation with heathen,
animistic images in the lyrics.  Although none of the other members of
the group were apparently involved in this project, there is still a
great deal in common with Hedningarna's mixture of medieval modes and
modern rock sensibility.  Kurki-Suonio favors a lighter texture, with
a bouncier, dancehall feel in the uptempo numbers rather than the
drone and heavy-metal ponderousness of Hedningarna.  This music is
danceable in the fun sense rather than in the ritual sense evoked by
Hedningarna.<p>

<a name="ujumbe"></a>
<b>Samba Mapangala and Orchestra Virunga</b><br>
<em>Ujumbe</em><br>
<a href="http://www.sternsmusic.com">Stern's/Earthworks</a><p>

<em>Virunga Volcano</em>, the 1980s work of Samba Mapangala and
Orchestra Virunga released by Earthworks in 1990, has endured as a
classic of African pop music.  Although originally from the Congo and
a purveyor of the dominant rumba Lingala, Mapangala migrated eastward
to Kenya and began incorporating elements of the local pop music and
language to create a melange that became a distinctly East African
sound.  The big hit from that collection, "Malako," was all rapid
feet-on-fire bass, chattering teeth hi-hat, muted guitar, up-front
sax, and airy vocals floating over the stripped down instrumental
assemblage.  No synth wash or hardly even a snare or tom-tom run to
fill the empty sonic spaces between the polyphonic lines.  It was a
minimalist approach that distinguished it from other rumba-derived
musics coming out at the time.  Mapangala has migrated some more in
the meantime (he now resides in the U.S.), and has put out
<em>Ujumbe</em> after a four-year hiatus from touring.  Although this
new album retains the spare instrumental approach, the production is
more conventional and filled out (i.e., more typical of a Parisian
<em>soukous</em> release), not surprising given that the co-producer
is Bopol Mansiamina of Quatre &Eacute;toiles fame.  The music itself
is more of a return to Mapangala's Congolese roots, albeit with a good
deal of variety.  "Dunia Tuna Pita" ought to get considerable air play
as an exemplar of the classic Congolese rumba form, while "Umoja Ni
Nguvu" starts out right away with a banging <em>sebene</em> section.
There is even a tasteful acoustic number ("Muniache") <em>&agrave;
la</em> Jean Bosco Mwenda, a pioneer of the Congo-Kenya musical
connection.  The uniformly high level of song writing throughout the
CD makes one suspect that Mapangala has been building up a collection
in his head since the last release.  In summary, even though some old
fans may be disappointed that <em>Ujumbe</em> is not a continuation of
Mapangala's Kenya-era sound, it should stand on its own as another
successful milestone in the peripatetic musician's career.<p>

<a name="misra"></a>
<b>Gopal Shankar Misra</b><br>
<em>Out of Stillness</em><br>
<a href="http://realworld.on.net/rwr">RealWorld</a><p>

With a range of five octaves, fretless board, four main and five
secondary (drone) strings overlying thirteen sympathetic strings, the
<em>vichitra veena</em> is a complex and flexible instrument.  Set
horizontally atop two resonant gourds, its timbre is reminiscent of
the better known sitar.  The <em>veena</em> family of chordophones is
said to predate the sitar in Indian musical history.  Following in his
father, Lalmani Misra's, footsteps, Gopar Shankar took the
<em>vichitra veena</em> out of its northern Indian classical music
confines to a wider audience.  On this recording, however, he goes
back to its roots and plays accompanied only by a <em>tanpura</em> and
tabla.  Impeccably recorded at RealWorld Studios right after a WOMAD
appearance, this CD, sadly, is his final recording.  Shortly after it
was made, Dr. Gopal Shankar Misra died at a concert dedicated to his
father.  This album is a fine showcase for Misra's virtuosity and
sensitivity as an ensemble player and leader.  The raga are played
with a tasteful mix of deliberation and spontaneity, with a satisfying
emotional arc that characterize top-rank Indian classical
performances.  The sound quality and balance are excellent
throughout.<p>

<a name="moradi"></a>
<b>Aliakbar Moradi and Pejman Hadadi</b><br>
<em>Whisper</em><br>
<a href="http://www.kereshmeh.com">Kereshmeh Records</a><p>

<b>Aliakbar Moradi and Parvin Namazi</b><br>
<em>Kurdaneh</em><br>
<a href="http://www.quartertone.com">QuarterTone Productions</a><p>

Kurdistan is a cultural and ethnic zone of identity with transnational
boundaries encompassing Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran, and small parts of
Armenia.  Officially stateless for centuries, the Kurds nevertheless
number an estimated 25 to 30 million and ranks as the fourth largest
ethnic group in the Middle East.  They suffer persecution and
discrimination to varying degrees in their respective "countries" and
their musical traditions have likewise been subject to differing
levels of restrictions.  For example, Kurdish music was banned until
recent years in Turkey, and prominent Kurdish musicians like Sivan
Perwer had to live in exile and issue releases abroad.  The horrific
attacks on Iraqi Kurds by Saddam Hussein has been well publicized in
the Western media.  By comparison, treatment of the Kurds by the
Iranian government has been generally less brutal, perhaps moderated
by the closer ties between the Kurdish and Persian languages and
cultures.<p>

In these two CDs, Aliakbar Moradi, a Kurdish master of the
<em>tanbur</em>, teams up with Pejman Hadadi, an Iranian percussionist
living in the U.S., and Parvin Namazi, an Iranian singer who became
interested in Kurdish music.  <em>Whisper</em> is a follow-up to
Moradi and Hadadi's 1999 album, <em>Fire of Passion</em>.  Here
Moradi's instrumental chops shine throughout with unrelentless
intensity.  The <em>tanbur</em> is a long-necked lute made of mulberry
wood with three metal strings running over fourteen gut frets, with
the top string serving as a sympathetic string.  Despite its limited
dynamic and pitch range, Moradi manages to coax an amazing variety of
tonal textures from his <em>tanbur</em> using a combination of picking
and strumming (or <em>shorr</em>, meaning "the pouring of water")
techniques, which imitate scenes from nature in such cuts as
"Partridge's Gait" and "Butterfly's Ascent."  Hadadi's accompaniment
merges seamlessly with Moradi's playing through all the meter and
tempo changes and matches Moradi's axe speed with rapid-fire fill-ins
of his own.  Although divided into fourteen cuts, this album of
48-minute duration should be enjoyed as one continuous piece.<p>

<em>Kurdaneh</em> is the more accessible of the two albums.
Essentially a fusion of Kurdish melodies and lyrics with a particular
mode of Persian urban traditional music, each song has a distinct
feel.  The backing ensemble produces a richer sonic texture with a
wind instrument (<em>ney</em>), Moradi branching out on
<em>setar</em>, bass <em>tar</em>, and <em>dohol</em>, plus
<em>tombak</em> and <em>daf</em> players providing the rhythmic
underpinning.  The breathy, wispy <em>ney</em> is an effective foil
for Namazi's full-throated alto, especially over the rolling caravan
beat of the opening song "Komel Kah."  Just sit back, relax, and let
her voice carry you to the land of the Kurds.<p>

<a name="praulins"></a> <b>Ugis Praulins</b><br> <em>Paganu

This is a high concept folk music album--and your reaction to it will
probably be determined by whether that sounds attractive or slightly
oxymoronic.  The songs are meant to sequence through "a whole year for
the inner self of an urban man."  If you are a folk purist, then it is
best to seek other sources for traditional Latvian music.  If you
don't mind generous doses of synth washes and world-beatification
through the addition of bongos, djembes, balafon, and kalimba, then no
problem.  Did I mention Enyaesque echoing plucked arpeggios?  The best
moments are when environmental sounds like wind and thunder are used
effectively to evoke a desolate landscape against which the melancholy
songs develop.<p>

<a name="laco"></a>

<a href="http://www.traditionalcrossroads.com/">Traditional Crossroads</a><p>

Rom (gypsy) music would appear to be ideally suited for fusion with
jazz, given the emphasis on instrumental chops and improvisational
proficiency.  This album provides evidence that there are other
factors to consider.  My conclusion is that this melding of styles
works best when one sticks to modal improvisation.  Jazz based on
chord progressions, especially when the harmony is laid out explicitly
on, say, keyboard, rather than sketched out implicity by a bass line,
yields a jarring, incongruous tonality when juxtaposed with
traditional Rom modal riffs.  The cuts on this disk that avoid
background sythesizer chords work better.  Although the clarinet takes
lead throughout, some of the best moments come when the <em>kanun</em>
(trapezoidal zither) is given free rein.  It's a worthwhile experiment
that has yielded mixed results.<p>

<a name="taitunambo"></a>
<b>Tai Tu Nam Bo</b><br>
<em>Saigon: Masters of Traditional Music</em><br>
<a href="http://www.hkw.de">Wergo</a><p>

A chordophone lover's delight, the pieces on this CD showcase various
combinations of eight different kinds of Vietnamese lutes, fiddles,
and zithers accompanied by vertical and transverse bamboo flutes.  The
one constant throughout is the clack of the <em>song lang</em>, a
block slitdrum played by foot, that marks the long cadences of this
musical genre called <em>don ca tai tu</em>.  Often mistranslated as
"amateur music" this "music of the talented" emerged during the
war-induced migration of refugees to southern Vietnam in the latter
half of the 19th century.  The mixing of various formal musical
traditions brought by refugees from different parts and the collapse
of any hierarchy associated with the original traditions led to a
freer form of entertainment music that was more accessible and
syncretic.  Informal gatherings in townhouse gardens and on boats in
the comfort of the cool evening breeze were the settings for the
soothing, freely improvisational repertoire sampled here.  Each
instrument has a specific timbre that evokes comparisons to other
familiar instruments such as the Chinese <em>pipa</em> or the Japanese
<em>koto</em>, but the <em>bau</em>, a single-string box zither, has a
truly unique, out-of-this-world sound that could only be likened to
the proto-electronic theremin.  The sound quality of the recording is
excellent and the illustrations of the instruments in the liner notes
are helpful.<p>

<a name="shakuhachi"></a>
<b>Tajima Tadashi</b><br>
<em>Master of Shakuhachi</em><br>
World Network<p>

A shakuhachi is a vertical bamboo flute of varying length with five
fingerholes, which was only allowed to be played by a Zen Buddhist
sect of itinerant monks in 16th and 17th century Japan.  Although long
secularized, the traditional repertoire still retains the original
religious emphasis on meditation.  Pieces move along slowly in
apparently free rhythm with the length of a breath the basic temporal
unit.  Although the instrument is structurally simple and pentatonic
in scale, much subtle variations in timbre and microtonal modulations
with embouchure change, head movements, and breath control are
effected by a master such as Tajima.  The selections on this generous
(72-min) album are all solo.  Excellent for relaxation/meditation.<p>

<a name="mahkalahke"></a>
<b>Transjoik</b><br>
<em>Mahkalahke</em><br>
Atrium<p>

Do not be misled by the mention of joiking, historical recordings, and
shaman frame-drums on this CD.  Transjoik is to traditional Sami
(Laplander) joiking what Steve Tibbetts's neoprimitivist sound
collages are to traditional West African percussion and
call-and-response chorals.  That is, don't buy this album if you want
to hear joiking in its original context--an expression and assertion
of individual identity within the vast openness of the Arctic
landscape by the chanting of a lone voice.  Transjoik perhaps intended
their joiking here set against a vast techno-industrial ambient
soundscape to be interpreted as the modern Sami trying to preserve and
assert his historical identity within the complex din of urban life
(they were funded by the Norwegian Sami Cultural Support
Organization).  Clearly the intent is serious; and yet it seems to
miss out on an essential aspect of the joik: joy.<p>

<b>The Uyghur Musicians of Xinjiang</b><br>
<em>Music From the Oasis Towns of Central Asia</em><br>
<a
href="http://www.acerecords.co.uk/labels/globlabel.html">GlobeStyle</a><p>

This would be a fun CD to play a game of "Guess the Music's Origin"
with your fellow world music enthusiasts.  Drop the laser "needle" on
Track 1 and you are greeted with a drum and double-reed processional
that places you in the lead-up to a raucous wedding celebration in
Turkey.  Moving on to Track 2 you are surrounded by a pentatonic
ensemble of bowed and plectrum-plucked strings topped by a swooping,
glissando vocal that plunks you down in rural China somewhere.  On the
all-instrumental Track 3 you feel the entrancing drone of sympathetic
strings in the lutes that tug you back toward the Indian subcontinent.
The meditative solo singing accompanied by open diatonic strumming on
Track 4 flashes a wide-screen view of the vast Mongolian steppe in
your mind's eye.  The microtonal inflections in the fleet-fingered
steel-stringed lute passages on Track 5 wafts an aroma of Persian
spices into the room.<p>

Xinjiang-Uyghur is currently an autonomous region in China's extreme
northwest.  It is sometimes called "Chinese Turkestan" and has seen
its share of violent conflict between the largely Muslim Uyghurs and
the national government that has encouraged the transmigration of the
majority Han Chinese into the region.  Tracing their heritage back to
Central Asian Turkish people, the Uyghurs' music owes much in terms of
structure to Arabo-Persian <em>maqam</em>s (modes and melodic
patterns).  The strings and woodwinds are also obviously descended
from Middle Eastern instruments.  However, as one notes from listening
to this sampling of Uyghur music, it is clear that harmonic and
melodic elements from the neighboring Hans and Mongolians have been
incorporated into certain categories of music over the years, making
for an entertainingly rich melange that defies easy pigeonholing by
visiting ears.<p>

<a name="dalai"></a>
<b>Yat-Kha</b><br>
<em>Dalai Beldiri</em><br>
<a href="http://www.wicklowrecords.com">Wicklow</a><p>

Of course, comparisons to Huun-Huur-Tu are inevitable.  Although Tuvan
throat-singing is threatening to become the next pygmy polyphonic
chant or Bulgarian women's chorus in terms of
most-appropriated-world-music vocals, there still aren't _that_ many
musical groups from Tuva to have hit the international circuit.  In
fact, the two groups are not unrelated as leader Albert Kuvezin was a
founding member of HHT.  The difference between the two ensembles can
be summarized by one instrumental sound: distorted electric guitar.
This statement is disingenuous since the harp-like yat-kha is
prominently featured by the eponymous group, but it does point out the
philosophical difference in their approach to "popular" music.  While
HHT has followed a more folkloric (preservationist/revivalist) path
and is more of a "roots" group, Yat-Kha has forged ahead and out by
embracing the use of drum kit and electric guitar.  This is not to say
that they have abandoned or diluted their musical roots.  And I have
no gripes about non-Western musicians appropriating Western music much
like Western musicians did to others in the past.  It's just my own
cultural bias, I suppose, that makes me cringe when a fuzz-tone
electric guitar sound pops up between loping beats of a shamanic drum
and the ghostly overtones of throat singing.<p>

<a name="yim"></a>
<b>Yim Hok-Man</b><br>
<em>Poems of Thunder: The Master Chinese Percussionist</em><br>
<a href="http://www.hnh.com">Naxos World</a><p>

This CD contains both percussion-only set pieces and music from other
arenas (such as Beijing Opera), where the percussion accompanies a
larger orchestra.  Despite the title (in Chinese the cover reads
"Number One Drum"), the pieces where the drum plays a supporting role
outshine the "show-off" numbers.  The problem with the percussion-only
pieces is that they sound too precise, composed, somewhat sterile.
The tasteful studio sound does not help.  The more raucous orchestral
numbers, especially the final cut, "Triumphal Return of the Fishing
Boats," are much more exhilarating.  The skimpy notes are a minus.
It's impossible to get a good grasp of the context in which these
pieces are played.  It is essential to have informative notes when the
album contains a diverse range of styles as on this one.<p>

<b>Various Artists</b><br>
<em>Land of the Sufis: Soul Music from the Indus Valley</em><br>
<a href="http://www.shanachie.com">Shanachie</a><p>

This CD smacks of record company opportunism.  I imagine an executive
saying, "Oh my god, Nusrat is dead!  We need someone from Pakistan to
replace him as the driver of the hugely successful qawwali qrossover
bandwagon!"  So a recording team is dispatched to Lahore to scout out
an undiscovered megatalent.  An open invitation is sent out to the
community and musicians line up to take their crack at international
stardom.  I may be excessively cynical about the motivation, but the
m.o. for this recording was largely done in this way.  The positive
aspect is that this recording reveals the multiplicity of Sufi music
in Pakistan beyond the by-now-familiar genre of qawwali to Western
ears.  There is some wonderful instrumental work here, although the
recordings are suffused with too much reverb, giving them a studio
sheen that detracts from the sense of raw discovery that is the raison
d'etre of such a project.  The liner notes are also heavy on colorful
personality sketches and light on musicological low-down.  But despite
the problems, the album serves as a tantalizing appetizer to those
seeking a more balanced musical view of Sufism in Pakistan than
provided by all the qawwali recordings that have come out in recent
years.<p>

<em>Anthology of World Music: The Music of Islam and Sufism in
Morocco</em><br>
<a href="http://www.rounder.com">Rounder Records</a><p>

The ambiguous status of music in Islam as a religion and a culture is
well displayed in this reissued installment from Alain Danielou's
Anthology of Traditional Music of the World.  Beginning with the
mandatory call to prayer, common to all of the Islamic world, and a
solo Quranic chant, the recording moves on to sounds more peculiar to
Morocco.  An ensemble chant from the High Atlas region, for example,
shows traces of Berber influence in the interlocking percussive
breathing and pentatonic modes.  Straying further away from
conservative orthodoxy, Sufi trance music incorporates instruments
(which are forbidden inside mosques) such as the herrazi (a ceramic
vase drum) and the wailing ghaita (a double-reeded oboe-like horn).
One of the highlights of this CD is the full ambient village sounds
captured during such a trance performance that transports you to the
dusty heat of northwest Africa in your armchair.  There is also a
track of Gnawa ceremonial music, which clearly has deep roots in
sub-Saharan Africa as evidenced by the call-and-response patterns and
triple-on-duple rhythms.  Although relatively short (it was
transferred from two sides of an LP) with uneven recording quality
(some tracks have poor high-frequency response characteristic of many
old analog tapes), the album provides a diverse sampler for those
seeking an introduction to the spectrum of Islamic sounds found in
Morocco.<p>

This is another in the series of reissues from Alain Danielou's
Anthology of World Music compiled between 1968 and 1987.  The
selections vary from court and ritual music (including Buddhist
chants) to music meant purely for entertainment (but not extending to
the Western-style pop music prevalent among today's boombox-toting
youths).  Traditional Vietnamese music has strong roots in Chinese
music, with traces of Indian influence discernible in improvisational
preludes and certain drums.  A highlight for me in this two-CD set was
discovering the monochord, a peculiarly Vietnamese single-string
zither, that produces eerie, bowed-saw-like tones.  The intense
ornamentation on the wailing, ghaita-like oboe (which could be
described more as macrotonal rather than microtonal modulations) is
also a tonic in the second CD, which focuses on South Vietnam.  The
sound quality is only fair, with plenty of tape hiss and abrupt
cutoffs at the end of pieces, and the notes are heavy on technical
detail but lacking in cultural context.  The collection is nonetheless
a valuable survey and an excellent introduction to Vietnamese musical
traditions.<p>

<em>La Route des Gitans (The Gypsy Road)</em><br>
Auvidis/Ethnic<p>

Since the cinematic success of <em>Latcho Drom</em>, tracing the
historical geographical routes of the Roma (Gypsy) migration through
musical illustrations seems to have become a cottage industry.  For
example, currently a 30-member troupe called the Gypsy Caravan is
touring the U.S., featuring musicians and dancers from India,
Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Hungary, and Spain.  This CD is a
high-concept compilation along the same lines, raiding Auvidis's
catalog of recordings back to 1978.  Although the level of
musicianship is uniformly high, with emphasis on technical virtuosity
typical of Rom music (the same cannot be said for the recording
quality), as a pedagogic exercise it must be deemed a failure, with
barely a paragraph of loosely allusive notes to accompany it.  Here
was a chance to educate listeners, both musically and culturally,
about the oft-misunderstood (and maligned) Roma, and they blew it.
Too bad.<p>

<em>Living Art, Sounding Spirit: The Bali Sessions</em><br>
<a href="http://www.rykodisc.com">Rykodisc</a><p>

If you think that Gamelan Gong Kebyar and Kecak pretty much sum up the
state of music in Bali, then this three-CD set is for you.  Producer
Mickey Hart deliberately avoided the road oft traveled and has
provided us with vistas of the wonderfully heterogeneous soundscape of
Bali.  The disc surveys traditional Gamelans: Selonding, an ensemble
with iron gongs, the oldest (pre-Hindu) and most sacred on the island;
Gong Suling, with end-blown flutes, an informal ensemble played for
entertainment; Genggong, with sugar palm leaf jewUs harps, often used
for plays and dances about frog characters; and Jegog, an ensemble of
bamboo idiophones found only in a few villages in westernmost Bali,
played at water buffalo races.  Featured on the second disc are
Gamelan Joged Bumbung, a twentieth century ensemble composed of bamboo
xylophones, flutes, drums, cymbals, and a small gong, used for social
dancing; and a Kecak (chant chorus) performance accompanying the
telling of The Abduction of Sita.  The third disc contains three
contemporary compositions, each with distinctively nontraditional
elements such as polyphonic singing, but with roots firmly planted in
the Gamelan styles of the past.  The recording quality is excellent
and the liner notes are decent.  If you have only one album of
Balinese music and wish to hear more, this compilation is a great
choice.<p>

<em>The Road to Kes&cedil;an: Turkish Rom and Regional Music of Thrace</em><br>
<a href="http://www.traditionalcrossroads.com">Traditional Crossroads</a><p>

Impeccably assembled by musicologist Sonia Seeman, this CD presents
wedding music as performed by a Rom (gypsy) ensemble in Kes&cedil;an,
which is in the tiny fraction of Turkey that lies on the European
continent.  Consulting the musicians regarding song selection and
order to achieve an aesthetic sense that is true as possible to that
of the local community, Seeman takes great care to put the music in
context.  Extensive notes, photos, and an anecdote about a holiday
picnic provide us with a package that is not only exciting for the
ears, but also enlightening for the mind.  The music itself is a
classic Rom combination of songs drawn from the traditional local
repertoire and virtuosic improvisation.  Odd meters with a stop-and-go
feel abound for the dance numbers (9/8: 2+2+2+3, 7/8: 2+2+3), while
ribald lyrics spike the drinking table songs for men.  The melismatic
clarinet is king here, not the shriller double-reed timbre of the
<em>zurna</em>, which was the preferred instrument in older times.  A
violin, <em>kanun</em> (Turkish zither), c&uuml;mb&uuml;s&cedil; (a
banjo-like instrument), and drums (<em>davul</em> and
<em>darbuka</em>) round out the ensemble.  In a real wedding, there
would also be requests for more urban genres such as <em>arabesk</em>
and <em>fantazi</em>, but here the focus is on the traditional Rom
selections.  The only minor gripe I have is that this is a studio
recording, which misses out on the ambient noise of a field recording
(laughter, clapping, a rooster crowing, a drunk man getting sick) that
really makes you feel like you are there in the midst of it all.<p>

<em>Saraca: Funerary Music of Carriacou</em><br>
<a href="http://www.rounder.com">Rounder Records</a><p>

In the spring of 1962, the legendary folk musicologist Alan Lomax
traveled to the Lesser Antilles, where many islands were in the midst
of the exciting transition to independence from Britain.  The
recording sessions that Lomax held, therefore, had a political
dimension, i.e., to discover and disseminate the cultural
commonalities that might help form a basis for a unified
pan-West-Indian nation.  Although the dream of a postcolonial
federation never materialized, the music and story-telling collected
in this Caribbean Voyage series point out the various signifiers and
motifs that are common to the region, and which illuminate their roots
in African and European cultures.  Lomax's analysis of this material
is contained in the book, <em>Brown Girl in the Ring</em>.  Carricacou
is a small island in the Grenadines.  Although much of this CD is
devoted to documenting the Big Drum, a repertoire of song and dance
that is believed to have direct antecedents in the ritual musics of
specific West African ethnic groups such as the Temne, Manding, Ibo,
and Cromanti, the Euro-African synthesis as manifested in the
call-and-response renditions of classic Baptist hymns are also well
represented.  "Gone to Nineveh" is an especially fascinating example
of this latter style, with circular harmonized singing driven by a
form of rhythmic breathing called trumping that helps induce trance in
the singers.  Trumping is somewhat reminiscent of the periodic
grunting heard in certain Balinese music, e.g., in the Ramayana Monkey
Chant.  There are also folk stories recorded here, as well as a
previously unreleased interview by Lomax of Mary "May" Fortune with
interjections by her common-law husband Ferguson "Sugar Tamarind"
Adams, considered the "first couple" of music in Carriacou at the
time.  Not only do we get the rare chance to listen to the musicians
talk about their music, but also to the field musicologist who
normally remains discreetly off the record.  We get a hint of the
passion that lies behind the music and behind the man who dedicated
his life to getting it all down for posterity.<p>

<em>Tuva, Among the Spirits</em><br>
<a href="http://www.si.edu/folkways">Smithsonian Folkways</a><p>

In 1987, musicologist Ted Levin became the first American to conduct
ethnographic field work in Tuva, which was then a republic of the
Soviet Union.  The recordings he made, focusing on the traditional
multitonal throat singing, <a
href="writing/tuva.html"><em>kh&ouml;&ouml;mei</em></a>, became the
basis of the earlier CD <em>Tuva: Voices from the Center of Asia</em>,
which anticipated the later export and popularity of the group
Huun-Huur-Tu.  Keeping in mind the threat of rapid Westernization
effacing the role of music in the traditional Tuvan lifestyle, Levin
returned to Tuva with the members of Huun-Huur-Tu to document the
nature-mimetic aspects of <em>kh&ouml;&ouml;mei</em>.  As mentioned
above in my review of the Huun-Huur-Tuu album, listening to
<em>kh&ouml;&ouml;mei</em> as sung on horseback is an ear-opening
experience.  The rhythmic amplitude and timbre modulations employed in
certain styles of <em>kh&ouml;&ouml;mei</em> clearly must have
originated in the gentle, periodic jolts that the horse's gait
introduces to the singing.  Levin also discovers that
<em>borbangnadyr</em>, a gurgling sort of throat-singing, blends in
well with the sound of a flowing stream, and that the singer is able
to seek and match the characteristic modulations of the harmonics
generated by the rushing water.  There are other such sonic epiphanies
included in this album, and my hat goes off to recording engineer,
Joel Gordon, for having captured it all with great fidelity.  This
album provides us with insights about a musical culture that developed
primarily in communion with nature rather than with human
"civilization."  Let's hope that it does not turn out to be a
"historical" recording any time soon.<p>
