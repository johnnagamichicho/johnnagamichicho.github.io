<center><h1>What is Ed-ku?</h1></center>

Always wanted to do editorial cartoons but couldn't draw?  Think it's
too much work to write commentary on current affairs?  Well here's the
perfect solution: <b>Ed-ku (Editorial haiku)!</b>  An example:<p>

<center>
<b>Bill Gates sips Java<br>
Watching Web surfers from beach<br>
Mindful of Sun burn</b><p>
</center>

Count the syllables in each line.  5-7-5.  See?  It's simple.  It can
be funny, or tragic, or both.  Just think about anything that's
happening in the world on which you'd like to comment.<p>

<b>Please attach your name and e-mail address after the haiku; I will
not accept anonymous submissions.</b> Send as plain text.  You can
submit as many as you want, but I reserve the right to edit for
spelling, punctuation, and syllable count, or to reject any entry.<p>

<b>Note:</b> The definition of orthodox haiku is more complicated.
For example, check out <a
href="http://home1.pacific.net.sg/~loudon/alexey_def.htm">one
aficionado's haiku definition</a>.  Also, technically, editorial <a
href="http://www.umich.edu/~troq/Gardens/senryu.html"><em>senryu</em></a>
is closer to what we are doing than editorial haiku, although the
definition of haiku has been broadened by the <a
href="http://web.wanadoo.be/tempslibres/en/textes/matsudec.html">Matsuyama
Declaration</a>.  Besides, "<em>ku</em>" means "verse" in Japanese, so
Ed-ku is not at all a misnomer.<p>
