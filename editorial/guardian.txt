HEADLINE: Haiku news and comment;
The online Editorial Haiku Page invites visitors to compose haiku about
something in the news - 'edku'. (Haiku, if you have not caught on to the
craze, are three-line Japanese poems consisting of 17 syllables, in a 5-7-5
formation.) Like the rest of this year's news, nearly all the 'edku' are
about the Clinton-Lewinsky saga

BODY:
Blowing sand here at

Monica Lewinsky Beach

See the Ken Starrfish?

A red rose petal

caresses Ken Starr's

pink nose.

He stifles a sneer.

Cum-stained cocktail

dress.

Garment threatened

President,

Dry cleaner saves day.

Glenn penetrates space.

Old farts' best dreams

wing with him

To orgasmic heights.

Hypocrites unite.

The pure denounce

sinful Bill.

Who are they fooling?

Tripp appears in court

my Shakespearean

retort?

dog will have its day.

We're back in Iraq.

When is a deal not a

deal?

When it's with Saddam.

Life seems more unfair

with every crisp

autumn day.

Clinton sins; Newt pays.

Monica's story

Now worth a million

dollars

That's hard to swallow.
