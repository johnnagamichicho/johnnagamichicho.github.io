Introduction and Atmospheric Change</center></h1>

<h2><font size="4">The atmosphere is the gaseous envelope around
our planet that protects us from the hazards of outer space.
Without the energy absorption provided by the atmosphere, solar X
rays, ultraviolet light, and high-energy particles would
penetrate to the earth's surface where we live. While the
atmosphere is thus strongly influenced by the sun, human
agriculture and technology also affect our atmosphere's chemistry
and climate.<br>

<h2>Atmospheric Studies at Arecibo</h2>

<p>The Arecibo Observatory was originally built as the world's
premier radar facility to study the upper part of the atmosphere
called the ionosphere, where many of the harmful wavelengths of
solar and cosmic radiation are filtered out. Since then we have
expanded our research to include the entire atmosphere, from the
ground into near space. Many new observational techniques have
been pioneered here, and we continue to dedicate our efforts to a
better understanding of our home planet's complex atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Weather and Climate in Space: The Sun vs. Humans</h2>

<p>Disturbances on the sun have a natural cycle of about 11 years,
and the climate of the upper atmosphere, or ionosphere, is
strongly linked to these changes in solar activity. The Arecibo
radar is able to measure ionospheric parameters, including the
types and amounts of gases present, their temperatures, and the
direction and speed of the winds. For example, the concentration
of helium ions in the upper atmosphere varies with the changes in
solar radiation. However, the sun is not the only player in this
game. The chemical composition of the sparse upper atmosphere is
also very sensitive to human activity. For example, greater
methane production due to increasing agriculture has resulted in
more hydrogen found at high altitudes. The Arecibo Observatory is
taking long-term measurements of this and other signs of changes
in our atmospheric climate.</p>

ions over the course of a single night. (Courtesy of S. Gonz&aacute;les
and M. Sulzer.)</font></p>

<p>The ionosphere not only has a climate, it also has day-to-day
weather. Sometimes the weather up there (&quot;space weather&quot;)
can be dramatic, such as when a solar flare triggers a
geomagnetic storm, which in turn can adversely affect
communication and navigation satellites and electric power grids.
Scientists are developing mathematical models to provide the
space weather forecasts needed to protect these systems, and
measurements made at Arecibo are an essential ingredient for
testing such models. Even if perfected, forecasting models will
always be dependent on having high quality measurements to
provide a starting point for their predictions.</p>

<h1><center>Arecibo Observatory Atmospheric Sciences: <br>
Meteors and Waves</center></h1>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Each day many tons of meteoroids are
vaporized while entering the earth's atmosphere. The meteors,
their trails, and the layers of particles they leave behind can
all be observed with the arecibo radar. Another fascinating
phenomenon is buoyancy waves, which travel throughout the
atmosphere, just as ocean waves constantly roll across the sea.<br>
</strong></font></p>

<h2>Up in Smoke: Blazing Meteors</h2>

longer-lasting tail produced by the interaction of the meteor
with the ionosphere. (Courtesy of Q. Zhou.)</font></p>

<p>In addition to receiving radiation and particles from the sun,
the Earth is also bombarded by over 100 tons of meteoroids each
day. Most of them burn up in the lower ionosphere and leave
behind vaporized rock and metal. The larger meteoroids emit light
as they vaporize, which we see at night as sudden bright streaks
in the sky. Radars can detect meteors that are not visible to the
eye, and the Arecibo radar is the world's most sensitive one for
this purpose. Over time the meteoric smoke condenses into dust,
and the heavier particles sink through the atmosphere and provide
the seeds for cloud formation. For example, polar stratospheric
clouds, which are a key ingredient in the formation of the ozone
hole, grow around these meteoric dust grains.</p>

<h2>Waves, Layers, and Extraterrestrial Metals</h2>

<p>An incredible variety of phenomena can be observed with the
Arecibo radar in the nighttime ionosphere. Vaporizing meteoroids
leave behind thin horizontal layers of extraterrestrial metallic
ions at around 100 kilometers (60 miles) altitude. Atmospheric
buoyancy waves traveling all the way up from near the ground then
create the up-and-down wiggles that are seen in these layers.
These buoyancy waves are analogous to ocean waves and occur
throughout the atmosphere. Such waves are generated by, among
other things, thunderstorms and winds blowing up and down across
mountains. If you look at the sky from the ground or from an
airplane, you can sometimes see regularly spaced rows of clouds
created by these same buoyancy waves.</p>

<h2>A Ghostly Glow in the Night Sky</h2>

wide-angle infrared camera showing two buoyancy waves crossing
each other. (Courtesy of M. Taylor and F. Garc&iacute;a.)</font></p>

<p>In addition to the radar systems, the Arecibo Observatory also
has optical instruments to study the atmosphere. At night, if
your eyes were sensitive enough you would see a faint glow in the
sky. This luminescence is called airglow, and it is the result of
chemical reactions that occur at an altitude of about 90
kilometers (55 miles). Because the airglow brightness is affected
by atmospheric motions, we can use it to get a picture of what is
happening at that height. One can often see buoyancy waves
rippling through the airglow layer like waves on a pond surface.
These waves travel throughout the atmosphere and help to move
energy and momentum from one place to the other. Because of this,
our understanding of buoyancy waves is extremely important to our
understanding of the atmosphere as a whole.</p>

<h1><center>Arecibo Observatory Atmospheric Sciences: <br>
Clouds and Plasma</center></h1>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Some clouds are too thin to be seen
with the naked eye. A lidar can detect such clouds. It operates
like a radar but uses visible or infrared waves in place of radio
waves, and can observe things that a radar can not. Another
important instrument at Arecibo is the HF (high frequency)
facility, which is an upward-pointing shortwave radio transmitter
used to study plasma waves and turbulence in the ionosphere.<br>
</strong></font></p>

<h2>Laser Light Show for Science</h2>

<p>Arecibo scientists also study the atmosphere using optical
radars known as lidars. A lidar works almost exactly like a radar--the
difference is that pulses of light instead of radio pulses are
used. This difference can be seen in their names: RADAR stands
for RAdio Detection And Ranging, while LIDAR stands for LIght
Detection And Ranging. Lidars can measure atmospheric density,
temperature, winds, as well as dust and pollutants. The
extraterrestrial metal atoms deposited in the upper atmosphere by
meteors can also be observed by the Arecibo lidars.</p>

overlaid with horizontal wind measurements made by radar. The
thick, bright layers at the left of the plot are clouds that
resulted from a thunderstorm. The thin layer in the middle of the
plot is due to clouds which cannot be seen by the naked eye. (Courtesy
of P. Castleberg and J. Cho.)</font></p>

<p>The lidar provides crucial information that the radar cannot
obtain. For example, high-altitude clouds too thin to be seen by
the naked eye can be detected using a lidar. Such &quot;invisible&quot;
clouds are thought to play an important role in exchanging water
between the troposphere and the stratosphere, and the sensitivity
of the lidar measurements helps us to learn much more about them.
The wind information provided simultaneously by the radar gives
us the background motions under which this exchange occurs.</p>

<h2>The Big Plasma Laboratory in the Sky</h2>

<p>The scientific name for the gas of ions and electrons that
makes up the ionosphere is &quot;plasma.&quot; Most people have
heard of the three states of matter--solid, liquid, and gas--but
few know about plasma, which can behave in such startlingly
different ways that physicists call it the fourth state. Most of
the universe, including the solar wind, stars, and galaxies, is
composed of plasma, so it is of great interest to scientists.
Plasma can be found on Earth in special laboratory chambers,
inside neon signs, and can also be briefly created by lightning
bolts and fire.</p>

produced tubes of decreased electron density along the Earth's
magnetic field. The rocket data shows that it flew through two of
these tubes. (Courtesy of M. Kelley, T. Arce, and M. Sulzer.)</font></p>

<p>The ionosphere provides us with a natural plasma laboratory in
the sky. This &quot;space laboratory&quot; can be used for
studying plasma phenomena in ways that cannot be duplicated in
laboratories located on Earth. For example, using Arecibo's
powerful HF (high frequency) radiowave transmitter we can produce
short-lived plasma waves and turbulence in the ionosphere, which
can then be observed with radars, optical instruments, and
instruments flown on rockets.</p>
